    "description": "Thomas Edward Hulce was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in Plymouth, MI, where he was raised with his two sisters and older brother. He is the son of Joanna (Winkleman), who had sung professionally, and Raymond Albert Hulce, who worked for Ford. He has English, German, and Irish ancestry. Wanting to be a singer, Tom had to make a switch in plans when his voice began changing. Knowing that if he wanted to be in show business he needed to become an actor, Tom began taking the necessary steps almost immediately. When asked once why he chose acting Tom replied, \"Because someone told me I couldn't.\" It is determination like this that has helped him achieve his respected position in the acting community to this day. Tom set goals early on. Graduating from school at 19 years old, he gave himself a decade to succeed as an actor. Working in Ann Arbor as usher and ticket seller with a small theatrical company was a start. It was around this time he saw the first play and actor that made him realize that acting was \"cool.\" Christopher Walken was in a play in Stratford, Ontario. The performance made quite an impression on Tom. While Mr. and Mrs. Hulce weren't totally sold on the idea of their son becoming a thespian, Tom had determination and headed off for the training he knew he'd need if he was going to achieve his goal. He studied at the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem; at Booth Bay Harbor, Maine; Sarasota, Florida; and spent a summer in England before heading off to New York City to try his hand at Broadway. Within a month after his arrival, Tom was chosen to understudy the role being performed by in the Broadway play \"Equus.\" He had originally been hired to play one of the horses, but it was decided that his time was better spent learning the understudy role and so he never donned the horse's attire. Tom had pangs of guilt where this role was concerned. On one hand he wanted the role ... badly. On the other hand he wondered what would happen if Peter left the role; could he fill those shoes? When the time came, nine months after being hired, Tom found out that it was up to him to play the role as his own. He wasn't expected to be another Peter Firth... he had been hired to play the role his way. \"... it actually went quite well, \" Tom recalled. \"I realized I was a different actor and that I would tackle the part in my own way.\" And tackle it he did! Equus has a few \"firsts\" for Tom. One, it was his first big role; two, it was his first Broadway role and third, it was his first nude performance. For nine minutes Tom and his costar, Roberta Maxwell, were naked in a scene that seemed impossible for the stage a decade earlier (1960s). In a past interview Tom reflected, \"It's so skillfully written and developed that it doesn't seem an unusual thing to do. There's no embarrassment, I just don't think about it at all.\" During the run of \"Equus,\" Tom turned down a big television offer, to the delight of the director and cast. At that time in Tom's life the stage was all there was, and he was going to do it right! Other plays that followed \"Equus\" were 's \"Butter and Egg Man,\" 's \"Memory of Two Mondays,\" along with such works as \"Julius Caesar,\" \"Romeo and Juliet,\" Shaw's \"Candida,\" and Chekhov's \"The Sea Gull,\" and, again on Broadway in his Tony nominated role in 's \"A Few Good Men.\" Tom has even directed the off-Broadway musical \"Sleep Around Town\" at Playwrights Horizon. Back in 1977 Tom landed his first motion picture role in the film about the day died, . This was to be the first of a long line of period films. His next was National Lampoon's . Set in the 1960's, Tom played \"Pinto\" along with such comedy alumni as 'John Belushi', , and . 1984 gave him the role that put him on the map. The title role of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the Oscar-winner was such a wonder that it even boosted the sales of Mozart's music by 30%! Filmed in Prague, it was eerie for Tom to actually be standing in the very spot where the original Amadeus had stood conducting the opera Tom was recreating for the film. Dressed in a purple velvet jacket, knickers, and white hose, wearing a bushy white wig and doling out a hilarious laugh (often likened to that of a hyena's) Tom's portrayal of the \"man-child\" musical genius was an Oscar-nominated performance. Tom has been in many more films set in the past: (1950s), (World War II), Mary Shelley's (1800s), (1930's), and Disney's (1500s). Tom appeared in with , a film that had a struggle to get released remains one of Tom's best performances and one that he is quite proud of. Another film that Tom feels a lot of pride for is . Starring with and , Tom played Dominick Luciano, a mentally handicapped twin brother to Liotta's Eugene. The young man works as a garbage collector to help put his brother through medical school so he can become a \"rich doctor\" and they can afford to get a \"house by a lake.\" Tom spent time studying people in a Pittsburgh neighborhood and handicapped people in an occupational training center so he could master the innocence and determination that the lead role required. He received the Best Actor award at the Seattle Fest for his performance. was Tom's second television movie (the first was (aka \"Neli, Neli\"), a Hallmark Hall of Fame production). Playing the role of Michael Schwerner, the New York social worker and Freedom Fighter who is murdered by K.K.K. members in 1964 during Freedom Summer, Tom received an Emmy nomination and his third Golden Globe nomination. (aka \"The Projectionist\") took Tom to Russia where he was Ivan Sanshin, the private film projectionist to Stalin within the Kremlin walls. Based on a true story, Ivan was a perfect example of how many were blinded to the horrific conditions that men like Stalin conducted and followed in ignorant loyalty. While there, Tom was fortunate to meet and spend time with Alexander Ganshin, upon whose life the film was based. The next three years held special items for Tom. His portrayal of Peter Patrone, in T.N.T.'s , earned him an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Special, and 1994 and 1996 brought two of Tom's last period pieces. Mary Shelley's had Tom playing opposite as Victor Frankenstein's college chum, Henry. And 1996 was a whole new experience for Tom. Disney was looking for someone special to portray their gentle Quasimodo in their newest full feature animation motion picture, . Tom had never done voiceover work for a full film; to sing before a microphone was one thing, but to do song and voice for someone that he couldn't watch while performing was a whole new experience for him. Herecalled that when he first auditioned he thought it strange that the producers and director stood looking at the floor while he sang...until he noticed they were looking at sketches of Quasimodo and were trying to \"feel\" if he sounded like their bell ringer. 1998 saw Tom returning to the stage but this time as director again, as he undertook the enormous task of bringing 's 1985 novel, \"The Cider House Rules\", to the stage. An 8-hour production which required the audience two days to see the whole performance, it was quite an undertaking. Co-directing with Jane Jones (of \"BookIt\" in Seattle, Washington) Tom took the play from its Seattle opening to the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, California where it received wonderful reviews. During the past recent years Tom has resided in Seattle, Washington where he owns his own home. He figures he could live in Los Angeles or New York - the acting hubs - but in Seattle, he's near the things he loves. \"Up in Seattle people look after their lives in a way you can't do in New York or Los Angeles,\" he says. But no matter where he calls home, we can always count on Tom for bringing us into a world that will thrill, excite, fascinate, move and inspire us either through his films, the stage, or his beautiful singing."

His athletic skills helped him land a role in the musical \"Can Can\" in 1978, which also sparked his interest in acting. After finishing school, Heino Ferch devoted himself to his acting training at the Salzburg Mozarteum. In addition to the classical acting courses, he was also trained here in singing, ballet and tap dancing.

During this time he had several guest appearances at the Scala in Milan, at the Salzburg Festival and at the Burgtheater in Vienna. He quickly attracted attention both through his performance in the theater and in film. He received particular praise for his portrayal of ObersturmbandfÃ¼hrer Raufeisen in \"Unhold\" (1996) and for his portrayal of Gestapo leader Klaus Barbie in \"Lucie Aubrac\" (1996). His role as Roman Cycowski in the hit production \"Comedian Harmonists\" helped him achieve widespread popularity in 1997.

    "description": "Fred MacMurray was likely the most underrated actor of his generation. True, his earliest work is mostly dismissed as pedestrian, but no other actor working in the 1940s and 50s was able to score so supremely whenever cast against type. Frederick Martin MacMurray was born in Kankakee, Illinois, to Maleta Martin and Frederick MacMurray. His father had Scottish ancestry and his mother's family was German. His father's sister was vaudeville performer and actress . When MacMurray was five years old, the family moved to Beaver Dam in Wisconsin, his parents' birth state. He graduated from Beaver Dam High School (later the site of Beaver Dam Middle School), where he was a three-sport star in football, baseball, and basketball. Fred retained a special place in his heart for his small-town Wisconsin upbringing, referring at any opportunity in magazine articles or interviews to the lifelong friends and cherished memories of Beaver Dam, even including mementos of his childhood in several of his films. In \"Pardon my Past\", Fred and fellow GI William Demarest are moving to Beaver Dam, WI to start a mink farm. MacMurray earned a full scholarship to attend Carroll College in Waukesha, Wisconsin and had ambitions to become a musician. In college, MacMurray participated in numerous local bands, playing the saxophone. In 1930, he played saxophone in the Gus Arnheim and his Coconut Grove Orchestra when Bing Crosby was the lead vocalist and Russ Columbo was in the violin section. MacMurray recorded a vocal with Arnheim's orchestra \"All I Want Is Just One Girl\" -- Victor 22384, 3/20/30. He appeared on Broadway in the 1930 hit production of \"Three's a Crowd\" starring , and . He next worked alongside in the 1933 production of \"Roberta\" before he signed on with Paramount Pictures in 1934 for the then-standard 7-year contract (the hit show made Bob Hope a star and he was also signed by Paramount). MacMurray married Lillian Lamont (D: June 22, 1953) on June 20, 1936, and they adopted two children. Although his early film work is largely overlooked by film historians and critics today, he rose steadily within the ranks of Paramount's contract stars, working with some of Hollywood's greatest talents, including wunderkind writer-director (whom he intensely disliked) and actors and . Although the majority of his films of the 30's can largely be dismissed as standard fare there are exceptions: he played opposite in seven films, beginning with . He also co-starred with in the classic, , and with in , -- an ambitious early outdoor 3-strip Technicolor hit, co-starring with and directed by -- , and . MacMurray spent the decade learning his craft and developing a reputation as a solid actor. In an interesting sidebar, artist C.C. Beck used MacMurray as the initial model for a superhero character who would become Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel in 1939. The 1940s gave him his chance to shine. He proved himself in melodramas such as and musicals (), somewhat ironically becoming one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors by 1943, when his salary reached $420,000. He scored a huge hit with the thoroughly entertaining , again teamed with Ms. Colbert and today largely remembered for launching the long-running Ma and Pa Kettle franchise. In 1941, MacMurray purchased a large parcel of land in Sonoma County, California and began a winery/cattle ranch. He raised his family on the ranch and it became the home to his second wife, after their marriage in 1954. The winery remains in operation today in the capable hands of their daughter, Kate MacMurray. Despite being habitually typecast as a \"nice guy\", MacMurray often said that his best roles were when he was cast against type by . In 1944, he played the role of \"Walter Neff\", an insurance salesman (numerous other actors had turned the role down) who plots with a greedy wife to murder her husband in -- inarguably the greatest role of his entire career. Indeed, anyone today having any doubts as to his potential depth as an actor should watch this film. He did another stellar turn in the \"not so nice\" category, playing the cynical, spineless \"Lieutenant Thomas Keefer\" in the 1954 production of , directed by . He gave another superb dramatic performance cast against type as a hard-boiled crooked cop in . Despite these and other successes, his career waned considerably by the late 1950s and he finished out the decade working in a handful of non-descript westerns. MacMurray's career got its second wind beginning in 1959 when he was cast as the dog-hating father figure (well, he was a retired mailman) in the first live-action comedy, . The film was an enormous hit and Uncle Walt green lighted several projects around his middle-aged star. Billy Wilder came calling again and he did a masterful turn in the role of Jeff Sheldrake, a two-timing corporate executive in Wilder's Oscar-winning comedy-drama , with and -- arguably his second greatest role and the last one to really challenge him as an actor. Although this role would ultimately be remembered as his last great performance, he continued with the lightweight Disney comedies while pulling double duty, thanks to an exceptionally generous contract, on TV. MacMurray was cast in 1961 as Professor Ned Brainerd in Disney's and in its superior sequel, . These hit Disney comedies raised his late-career profile considerably and producer beckoned with debuting in 1960 on ABC. The gentle sitcom staple remained on the air for 12 seasons (380 episodes). Concerned about his work load and time away from his ranch and family, Fred played hardball with his series contract. In addition to his generous salary, the \"Sons\" contract was written so that all the scenes requiring his presence to be shot first, requiring him to work only 65 days per season on the show (the contract was reportedly used as an example by when negotiating the wildly generous terms contained in his later variety show contract). This requirement meant the series actors had to work with stand-ins and posed wardrobe continuity issues. The series moved without a hitch to CBS in the fall of 1965 in color after ABC, then still an also-ran network with its eyes peeled on the bottom line, refused to increase the budget required for color production (color became a U.S. industry standard in the 1968 season). This freed him to pursue his film work, family, ranch, and his principal hobby, golf. Politically very conservative, MacMurray was a staunch supporter of the Republican Party; he joined his old friend and in campaigning for Richard Nixon in 1968. He was also widely known one of the most -- to be polite -- frugal actors in the business. Stories floated around the industry in the 60s regarding famous hard-boiled egg brown bag lunches and stingy tips. After the cancellation of My Three Sons in 1972, MacMurray made only a few more film appearances before retiring to his ranch in 1978. As a result of a long battle with leukemia, MacMurray died of pneumonia at the age of eighty-three in Santa Monica on November 5, 1991. He was buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City."

In 1917, diagnosed as shell-shocked, he was invalided out and advised to take up acting as therapy. In a few years, his name was famous on the stages of London and New York. He made his first movie in 1914: (). He became known as the perfect Englishman (slim, tall, intellectual, and sensitive), a part that he played in many movies which set women to dreaming about him. His first sound movie came out in 1930: , an adaptation of the stage play in which he starred. In and , he played the Englishman role to the hilt. His screen persona could perhaps best be summed up by his role as Sir Percy Blakeney in , a foppish society gentleman. It was Howard who insisted that get the role of Duke Mantee in , a role that Bogart had played in the stage production. As he became more successful, he also became quite picky about which roles he would do, and usually performed in only two films a year. In 1939, he played the character that will always be associated with him, that of Ashley Wilkes, the honor-bound, disillusioned intellectual Southern gentleman, in . However, war clouds were gathering over England, and he devoted all his energy on behalf of the war effort. He directed films, wrote articles and made radio broadcasts. He died in 1943, when the KLM plane he was in was shot down by German fighters over the Bay of Biscay."

    "description": "Cleft-chinned, steely-eyed and virile star of international cinema who rose from being \"the ragman's son\" (the name of his best-selling 1988 autobiography) to become a bona fide superstar, Kirk Douglas, also known as Issur Danielovitch Demsky, was born on December 9, 1916 in Amsterdam, New York. His parents, Bryna (Sanglel) and Herschel Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mahilyow Voblast (now in Belarus). Although growing up in a poor ghetto, Douglas was a fine student and a keen athlete and wrestled competitively during his time at St. Lawrence University. Professional wrestling helped pay for his studies as did working on the side as a waiter and a bellboy. However, he soon identified an acting scholarship as a way out of his meager existence, and was sufficiently talented to gain entry into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He made his Broadway debut in \"Spring Again\" before his career was interrupted by World War II. He joining the United States Navy in 1941, and then after the end of hostilities in 1945, returned to the theater and some radio work. On the insistence of ex-classmate , movie producer screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in . His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama , the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend . Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western , the political thriller and their final pairing in the gangster comedy . Douglas once said about his good friend: \"I've finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I've got nice-looking girls in my films now.\" After appearing in \"I Walk Alone,\" Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping . The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in and as tortured painter in , both directed by . In 1955, Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director 's brilliant anti-war epic . Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent . The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter , who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas' insistence, Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives. Douglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in , acted alongside in the World War II story , again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, , and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western . Additionally in 1963, he starred in an onstage production of 's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk's talented son finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring . Into the 1970s, Douglas wasn't as busy as previous years; however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young in the loopy western comedy , then with in the sci-fi thriller and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama . Unknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1981), and with the Jefferson Award (1983). Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002). Despite a helicopter crash and a stroke suffered in the 1990s, he remained active and continued to appear in front of the camera.

Chow was born in 1955 on the quiet island of Lamma, part of the then-British colony of Hong Kong, near its famous Victoria Harbour. His mother was a vegetable farmer and cleaning lady, and his father worked on a Shell Oil Company tanker. Chow's family moved to urban Hong Kong in 1965 and in early 1973, Chow attended a casting call for TVB, a division of Shaw Bros. productions. With his good looks and easy-going style, Chow was originally a heartthrob actor in non-demanding TV and film roles. However, his popularity increased with his appearance as white-suited gangster Hui Man-Keung in the highly popular drama TV series . In 1985, Chow started receiving acclaim for his work and scored the Golden Horse (Best Actor) Award in Taiwan and another Best Actor Award from the Asian Pacific Film Festival for his performance in . With these accolades, Chow came to the attention of Woo, who cast Chow in the fast-paced gangster film (aka \"A Better Tomorrow\"). The rest, as they say, is history. The film was an enormous commercial success, and Chow's influence on young Asian males was not dissimilar to the adulation given to previous Asian film sensations such as or . Nearly every young guy in Hong Kong ran out and bought himself a \"Mark Coat,\" as they became known--a long, heavy woolen coat worn by Chow in the movie (although it is is actually very unsuited to Hong Kong's hot and humid climate). Further hard-edged roles in more John Woo crime films escalated Chow's popularity even higher, and fans all over the world flocked to see (aka \"A Better Tomorrow 2\"), (aka \"The Killer\"), and (aka \"Hard Boiled\"). With the phenomenal global interest in the HK action genre, Chow was enticed to the United States and appeared in with , with , and, for a change of pace, in the often-filmed romantic tale of . Chow then returned to the Asian cinema circuit and starred in the critically lauded kung fu epic (aka \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\"). His wide appeal can be seen in his \"boy next door\" type of personality and his ability to play such a broad spectrum of roles from a comedic buffoon to a lovestruck Romeo to a trigger-happy professional killer.

His parents were Anna (Boselli), who had emigrated from Carpi (MO), Italy, and Camillo Borgnino, who had emigrated from Ottiglio (AL), Italy.

At age 18, after graduating from high school in New Haven, and undecided about his future career, he joined the United States Navy, where he stayed for ten years until leaving in 1945. After a few factory jobs, his mother suggested that his forceful personality could make him suitable for a career in acting, and Borgnine promptly enrolled at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford. After completing the course, he joined 's famous Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, staying there for four years, undertaking odd jobs and playing every type of role imaginable. His big break came in 1949, when he made his acting debut on Broadway playing a male nurse in \"Harvey\". In 1951, Borgnine moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie career, and made his film debut as Bill Street in . His career took off in 1953 when he was cast in the role of Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson in . This memorable performance led to numerous supporting roles as \"heavies\" in a steady string of dramas and westerns.

The personification of Curtis earned him several breakthrough awards and nominations. A former member of the National Youth Theatre, Riley was born in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. Before his breakthrough in Control, he appeared in a handful of short and TV films while his band \"10,000 Things\" was producing their works.

    "description": "John Cassavetes was a Greek-American actor, film director, and screenwriter. He is considered a pioneer of American independent film, as he often financed his own films. Cassavetes was born in New York City in 1929 to Nicholas John Cassavetes (1893-1979) and his wife, Katherine Demetre (1906-1983). Nicholas was an immigrant from Greece, while Katherine was Greek-American who had been born in New York City. The Cassavetes family moved back to Greece in the early 1930s, and John learned Greek as his primary language. The family moved back to the United States around 1936, possibly to evade Greece's new dictatorship, the 4th of August Regime (1936-1941). Young John had to learn to speak English. He spent his late childhood and most of his teenage years in Long Island, New York. From 1945-47, he attended the Port Washington High School. He wrote for the school newspaper and the school yearbook. The 18-year-old Cassavetes was then transferred to the Blair Academy, a boarding school located in Blairstown, New Jersey. When the time came for him to start college, Cassavetes enrolled at Champlain College (in Burlington, Vermont) but was expelled owing to poor grades. After a brief vacation to Florida, Cassavetes enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA), in New York City. Several of his old friends were already students there and had recommended it to Cassavetes, who would be mentored by Don Richardson (1918-1996). After graduating, he began to regularly perform on stage while also appearing in small roles in films and television shows. Cassavetes's first notable film role was that of Robert Batsford, one of the three villains (along with and ) in . His next major role was juvenile delinquent Frankie Dane in the crime film \"Crime in the Streets\" (1956). He won a lead role in as drifter Axel Nordmann. His co-star for the film was , who played stevedore Tommy Tyler. The film helped break new ground, portraying a working-class interracial friendship. Cassavetes gained critical acclaim for his role, and film critics compared him to . Cassavetes's success as an actor led to his becoming a contract player for MGM. In 1959, he directed his first film, . It depicted the lives of three African-American siblings in New York City. It won the Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival. His next directing effort, , was about the professional and romantic problems of a struggling jazz musician. The film was poorly received at the time, though its autobiographical elements are considered remarkable. Cassavetes then directed , which depicted life in a state institution for mentally handicapped and emotionally disturbed children. The film was a documentary-style portrayal of problems in the social services. It was praised by critics but failed at the box office. In 1968, Cassavetes had a comeback as a director with , which depicts a single night in the life of a middle-aged married couple. After 14 years of marriage, the two feel rather miserable and seek happiness in the company of friends and the beds of younger lovers, but neither manages to cure their sense of misery. The film gained critical acclaim, and, in 2011, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Cassavetes returned to the theme of a midlife crisis in his next film, . The film depicts three middle-aged men, professionally successful and seemingly happily married. The death of a close childhood friend reminds them of their own mortality, and of their fading memories of youth. They flee their ordinary lives with a shared vacation to London, but their attempts to rejuvenate themselves fail. This film attracted mixed reviews, with some critics praising its \"moments of piercing honesty\" and others finding fault with its rambling dialogue. Cassavetes's next film was , about the romantic relationship between a seemingly incompatible couple, jaded museum curator Minnie Moore and the temperamental drifter Seymour Moskowitz. It was well received and garnered Cassavetes a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen. His next film was , concerning the effects of mental illness on a working-class family. In the film, ordinary housewife Mabel Longhetti starts displaying signs of a mental disorder. She undergoes psychiatric treatment for six months while her husband, Nick Longhetti, attempts to play the role of a single father. But Nick seems to be a social misfit in his own right, and neither parent seems to be \"normal\". Cassavetes was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for this film, but the award was won by . Cassavetes next directed the gritty crime film, . In the film, Korean War veteran and cabaret owner Cosmo Vittelli owes a large debt to a criminal organization and is coerced to serve as their hit-man in an assassination scheme. He has been told that the target is an insignificant bookie, but after the assassination Vittelli learns that he just killed a high-ranking crime boss of the Chinese mafia and that he himself is now a target for assassination. The film gained good reviews and a cult following. His next film, , was more enigmatic, mixing drama with horror elements. Protagonist Myrtle Gordon (played by Cassavetes's wife, ) is a famous actress, but aging and dissatisfied with the only theatrical role available to her. After seeing teenager Nancy Stein, one of her obsessive fans , get killed in a car accident, Myrtle starts having visions of Nancy's ghost. As she keeps fighting the ghost, drinking heavily and chain-smoking, the film ends without explaining what seems to be going wrong with Myrtle's perception of reality. The film was a hit in Europe but flopped in the United States. Cassavetes had another directing comeback with \"Gloria\" (1980). In the film, Gloria Swenson (formerly a gangster's girlfriend) is asked to protect Phil Dawn, the young son of an FBI informant within a New York crime family. After the apparent assassination of Phil's parents, Gloria finds herself targeted by gangsters and wanted by the police as a kidnapping suspect. The film won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival, and protagonist was nominated for several acting awards. Cassavetes's 11th directing effort was the rather unconventional drama , about the relationship between two middle-aged siblings. In the film, Sarah Lawson suffers from depression following a messy divorce and moves in with her brother, Robert Harmon, an alcoholic writer with self-destructive tendencies. Though estranged from his ex-wife and his only son and unable to protect himself from violent foes, in the end Robert finally has someone for whom to care. The film won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. Cassavetes' swan song as a director was the comedy , replacing the much younger . The film concerns an insurance agent who needs $40,000 for college tuition for his three daughters. He agrees to cooperate in an insurance scam with the wife of one of his clients, though the plan may require them to murder her husband. Several elements of the film were recycled from the plot of the iconic film noir , and \"Big Trouble\" served as its unofficial remake. The film was unsuccessful, and Cassavetes himself reportedly disliked the script. In the late 1980s, Cassavetes suffered from health problems and his career was in decline. He died in 1989 from cirrhosis of the liver caused by many years of heavy drinking. He was only 59 years old. He is buried at the Westwood Village Memorial Park in Los Angeles, having left more than 40 unproduced screenplays and an unpublished novel. His son, , eventually used one of the unproduced screenplays to direct a new film, the romantic drama, . It was released eight years after the death of John Cassavetes, and was well received by critics."

    "description": "Tony Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz, the eldest of three children of Helen (Klein) and Emanuel Schwartz, Jewish immigrants from Hungary. Curtis himself admits that while he had almost no formal education, he was a student of the \"school of hard knocks\" and learned from a young age that the only person who ever had his back was himself, so he learned how to take care of both himself and younger brother, Julius. Curtis grew up in poverty, as his father, Emanuel, who worked as a tailor, had the sole responsibility of providing for his entire family on his meager income. This led to constant bickering between Curtis's parents over money, and Curtis began to go to movies as a way of briefly escaping the constant worries of poverty and other family problems. The financial strain of raising two children on a meager income became so tough that in 1935, Curtis's parents decided that their children would have a better life under the care of the state and briefly had Tony and his brother admitted to an orphanage. During this lonely time, the only companion Curtis had was his brother, Julius, and the two became inseparable as they struggled to get used to this new way of life. Weeks later, Curtis's parents came back to reclaim custody of Tony and his brother, but by then Curtis had learned one of life's toughest lessons: the only person you can count on is yourself. In 1938, shortly before Tony's Bar Mitzvah, tragedy struck when Tony lost the person most important to him when his brother, Julius, was hit by a truck and killed. After that tragedy, Curtis's parents became convinced that a formal education was the best way Tony could avoid the same never-knowing-where-your-next-meal-is-coming-from life that they had known. However, Tony rejected this because he felt that learning about literary classics and algebra wasn't going to advance him in life as much as some real hands-on life experience would. He was to find that real-life experience a few years later, when he enlisted in the navy in 1942. Tony spent over two years getting that life experience doing everything from working as a crewman on a submarine tender, the USS Proteus (AS-19), to honing his future craft as an actor performing as a sailor in a stage play at the Navy Signalman School in Illinois. In 1945, Curtis was honorably discharged from the navy, and when he realized that the GI Bill would allow him to go to acting school without paying for it, he now saw that his lifelong pipe dream of being an actor might actually be achievable. Curtis auditioned for the New York Dramatic Workshop, and after being accepted on the strength of his audition piece (a scene from \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" in pantomime), Curtis enrolled in early 1947. He then began to pay his dues by appearing in a slew of stage productions, including \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Golden Boy\". He then connected with a small theatrical agent named , who was the niece of film producer . After seeing his potential, Selznick arranged an interview for Curtis to see at Universal Studios, where Curtis was offered a seven-year contract. After changing his name to what he saw as an elegant, mysterious moniker--\"Tony Curtis\" (named after the novel by and a cousin of his named Janush Kertiz)--Curtis began making a name for himself by appearing in small, offbeat roles in small-budget productions. His first notable performance was a two-minute role in , with , in which he makes Lancaster jealous by dancing with . This offbeat role resulted in Curtis's being typecast as a heavy for the next few years, such as playing a gang member in . Curtis continued to build up a show reel by accepting any paying job, acting in a number of bit-part roles for the next few years. It wasn't until late 1949 that he finally got the chance to demonstrate his acting flair, when he was cast in an important role in an action western, . On the strength of his performance in that movie, Curtis was finally cast in a big-budget movie, . While he appears in that movie only very briefly, it was a chance for him to act alongside a Hollywood legend, . As his career developed, Curtis wanted to act in movies that had social relevance, ones that would challenge audiences, so he began to appear in such movies as and . He was advised against appearing as the subordinate sidekick in , playing second fiddle to the equally famous . However, Curtis saw no problem with this because the two had recently acted together in dual leading roles in ."

John was born in Washington, D.C., to Helen (Sperling), who acted in community theatre, and John Heard, who worked for the U.S. government. John established himself with roles in the movies , Chilly Scenes of Winter (1979) (a.k.a. \"Head Over Heels\"), and Heart Beat (1981) (in which he played to 's and 's ), before giving a tour de force performance as a hideously wounded (both physically and psychologically) Vietnam veteran in (a.k.a. \"Cutter and Bone\") opposite . He also shined as Reverend Dimmesdale (one of America's first religious hypocrites) in the 1979 PBS version of 's . Both \"Chilly Scenes of Winter\" and \"Cutter's Way\" (originally released as \"Head Over Heels\" and \"Cutter and Bone\", respectively) had been re-released under new titles after failing in their first go-rounds, such was the quality of the films. The two re-releases helped redefine the practice by which major studios handled smaller, art house quality pictures by releasing them carefully to select theaters with bespoke marketing campaigns so they reached the proper audience. (Studios would later develop their own art film-independent film subsidiaries to handle such pictures, so they didn't \"fall through the cracks\" like the first releases of the two Heard films.) By the early 1980s, Heard seemed on his way to establishing himself as a major American actor, if not on the path to movie stardom. At the time, there was a joke that involved confusing Heard with and because of the similarity of their last names. At the time these contemporaries were considered equal in terms of their star power. In the early '80s, it would not have been unreasonable to predict that Heard would become an Oscar winner or a multiple nominee. He continued to work on A-List projects, playing the not-so-sympathetic son to in (for which Page won her own Oscar) and 's adult rival in , but by the latter part of the decade he had failed to establish himself as a leading man and was playing supporting roles. Also appearing on television, he was nominated for an Emmy for his turn as a corrupt police detective on . John Heard died on July 21, 2017, in Palo Alto, California."

He was born on October 1, 1930, in Lille, Nord, France, into a middle class family of shopkeepers. His father was fond of literature. Young Noiret attended the College Janson-of-Sally in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. At school, he was more interested in acting than in academics; he failed to pass his baccalaureate exams three times and left school without graduation.

He landed his first leading role as Lui, a government inspector, in the French New Wave film by notable female director . His first big success came in 1960 with 's film (aka.. Zazie in the Metro). In 1968 he became a star in France with the title role in . After that success, Noiret moved on with his acting career and devoted himself almost entirely to the big screen. Noiret's trademark hangdog face and his range allowed him to portray a middle-class man or an aristocrat, but not a handsome romantic hero, so he was cast primarily as the Everyman character. In , an allegoric film about sex orgy and suicide by overeating, which caused a scandal at Cannes in 1973, Noiret co-starred in a controversial role as suicidal judge Philippe, alongside . Philippe Noiret shot to international fame with the supporting role as Alfredo, an old man who is a small town projectionist who befriends and inspires a young boy, in .

He also made excellent radio performances and popular books readings, which he narrated with his serious voice and impeccable diction. He was decorated with the Knight of the Legion of Honor. Philippe Noiret was also known as an elegant hedonist and an avid dog lover. His other interests outside of the acting profession included art, horses, gourmet cuisine and cigars. For about 30 years he resided in his country house in the wine country near Carcassonne, in the South of France, where he generously supported the local causes.

He grew up in poverty as the son of farmers, with his father also driving a cab in Nassau. Sidney had little formal education and at the age of 15 was sent to Miami to live with his brother, in order to forestall a growing tendency toward delinquency. In the U.S., he experienced the racial chasm that divides the country, a great shock to a boy coming from a society with a majority of African descent. At 18, he went to New York, did menial jobs and slept in a bus terminal toilet. A brief stint in the Army as a worker at a veterans' hospital was followed by more menial jobs in Harlem. An impulsive audition at the American Negro Theatre was rejected so forcefully that Poitier dedicated the next six months to overcoming his accent and improving his performing skills. On his second try, he was accepted. Spotted in rehearsal by a casting agent, he won a bit part in the Broadway production of \"Lysistrata\", for which he earned good reviews. By the end of 1949, he was having to choose between leading roles on stage and an offer to work for in the film . His performance as a doctor treating a white bigot got him plenty of notice and led to more roles. Nevertheless, the roles were still less interesting and prominent than those white actors routinely obtained. But seven years later, after turning down several projects he considered demeaning, Poitier got a number of roles that catapulted him into a category rarely if ever achieved by an African-American man of that time, that of leading man. One of these films, , earned Poitier his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Five years later, he won the Oscar for , the first African American to win for a leading role. He remained active on stage and screen as well as in the burgeoning Civil Rights movement. His roles in and were landmarks in helping to break down some social barriers between blacks and whites. Poitier's talent, conscience, integrity, and inherent likability placed him on equal footing with the white stars of the day. He took on directing and producing chores in the 1970s, achieving success in both arenas."

    "description": "Maximilian Schell was the most successful German-speaking actor in English-language films since Emil Jannings, the winner of the first Best Actor Academy Award. Like Jannings, Schell won the Oscar, but unlike him, he was a dedicated anti-Nazi. Indeed, with the exception of Maurice Chevalier and Marcello Mastroianni, Schell was undoubtedly the most successful non-anglophone foreign actor in the history of American cinema. Schell was born in Vienna, Austria on December 8, 1930, but raised in in Zurich, Switzerland. (Austria became part of Germany after the anschluss of 1938), then was occupied by the allies from 1945 until 1955, when it again joined the family of nations.) He learned his craft on the stage beginning in 1952, and made his reputation with appearances in German-language films and television. He was a fine Shakespearean actor, and had a huge success with \"Richard III\" (he has also appeared in as the eponymous prince in a German-language version of \"Hamlet\"). Schell made his Hollywood debut in 1958 in the World War II film quite by accident, as the producers had wanted to hire his sister , but lines of communication got crossed, and he was the one hired. He impressed American producers as his turn as the friend of German soldier , and subsequently assayed the role of the German defense attorney in the television drama on \"Playhouse 90\" in 1959. He was also cast in the big screen remake, for which he won the 1961 Academy Award for Best Actor, beating out co-star for the Oscar. He also won a Golden Globe and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for the role. Schell ultimately won two more Oscar nominations for acting, in 1976 for Best Actor for and in 1978 as Best Supporting Actor for (which also brought him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor). He has twice been nominated for an Emmy for his TV work, and won the 1993 Golden Globe for best performance by an actor in a supporting role in a series, mini-series or made-for-TV movie for . Schell has also has directed films, and his 1974 film (\"The Pedestrian\"), which Schell wrote, produced, directed, and starred in, was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar and won the Golden Globe in the same category. His documentary about Marlene Dietrich, , was widely hailed as a masterpiece of the non-fiction genre and garnered its producers a Best Documentary Oscar nomination in 1985. In 2002, Schell released (My Sister Maria), a documentary about the career of and his relationship with . Since the 1990s, Schell has appeared in many German language made-for-TV films, such as the 2003 film (All the Luck in the World) and in the mini-series , which was based on Henning Mankell's novel. He has also continued to appear on stage, appearing in dual roles in the 2000 Broadway production of the stage version of \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", and most recently in 's London production of 's play \"Resurrection Blues\" in 2006. He died on 31st of January 2014, aged 83, in Innsbruck, Austria."

He came direct from the hit 1940 original Broadway production of \"Pal Joey\" and planned to return to the Broadway stage after making the one film required by his contract. His first picture for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was with . What kept Kelly in Hollywood were \"the kindred creative spirits\" he found behind the scenes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The talent pool was especially large during World War II, when Hollywood was a refuge for many musicians and others in the performing arts of Europe who were forced to flee the Nazis. After the war, a new generation was coming of age. Those who saw would try to make real life as romantic as the reel life they saw portrayed in that musical, and the first time they saw Paris, they were seeing again in memory the seventeen-minute ballet sequence set to the title song written by and choreographed by Kelly. The sequence cost a half million dollars (U.S.) to make in 1951 dollars. Another Kelly musical of the era, , was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry. Kelly was in the same league as , but instead of a top hat and tails Kelly wore work clothes that went with his masculine, athletic dance style. Gene Kelly died at age 83 of complications from two strokes on February 2, 1996 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California."

    "description": "Aamir Khan was born on March 14, 1965 in Mumbai. He is one of the most successful Indian Bollywood actors who is also known as \"Mr. Perfectionist of Bollywood\". With his recent successes in both the Indian and Chinese film markets, he has shouldered his way into becoming one of the world's biggest superstars. Undergoing rapid transformations in his body structure to better embody the variegated characters in his energetic films, Aamir has garnered praise from all parts of the globe. His most visible transformations can be seen in such movies as Lagaan (2001), Fanaa (2006), Taare Zameen Par (2007), Ghajini (2008), 3 idiots (2009), Talaash (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), PK (2014), Dangal (2016) and Secret Superstar (2017). His recent successes with movies like Dangal, PK , Talaash and TV serial Satyamev Jayate have attracted attention from more serious moviegoing crowds. However, he is perhaps better known for his fabulous comedic roles, as exemplified by his iconic performances in cult comedies such as Andaz Apna Apna, Passion, and Dil Chahta Hai, to name a few. Aamir is also no slouch at TV commercial work. 2001's Lagaan released in China nationwide, beginning what would be a series of Aamir Khan films that would firmly plant Indian filmmaking into the minds of Chinese audiences. 3 Idiots became a cult hit in China farther along in the 2000's, followed by Like Stars on Earth and Ghajini, both of which went on to gain huge followings. Aamir Khan's streak of Chinese box office hits continued into and throughout the 2010's with the rapid-fire release of Dhoom 3 (2013), PK (2014), Dangal (2016) and Secret Superstar (2017). Aamir was first introduced as a child artist in the 1970's hit - he was the youngest child in the trio. His performance in as the Ice-Candy man has received rave reviews from Indian and international critics. Using classic \"method acting\" and an adopted technique inspired by his seniors Sanjeev Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, Dev Anand and Shammi Kapoor, Aamir acts in all genres of Indian films - comedy, action, drama and romance. He is regarded as a complete Indian actor of the post 1990 generation of actors for his diverse choice of roles and films. In 2007 he turned director with the film , which not only brought him immense critical acclaim but was also a huge box office success. Many of his films are considered as cult classics like , , , and . He divorced his first wife Reena Dutta on December 09, 2001 and married Kiran Rao in December 28, 2005 and divorced her on July 03, 2021. In 2008 his first all out commercial action film went on to become the highest grossing film of its time in Indian Cinema and 4th highest inflation adjusted, grossing a total of Rs.226 on the worldwide box office and the first film to cross 100 crores on the domestic Indian box office, making a total of Rs.115 crores. This record didn't last long, though, since his next release went on to shatter not only the highest grosser record but many more. It not only made the highest opening first day, first weekend and first week records but subsequently continued to shatter many records on the following weekends and weeks, making many circuits on the way. It made a total of Rs.202 crores domestically and Rs.400 crores on the worldwide box office, becoming the highest overseas grosser to date, a staggering feat given that no other film had even come close to making Rs.100 crores on the domestic box office until then, except for his own the previous year. Aamir is said to be the actor who first started the trend of actors working in one film at a time, when the others worked in four or five at the same time. He is also known to shun popular film trade magazine awards like Filmfare, Star Screen, etc. as he doesn't have trust in their credibility and transparency. Recently he was awarded the third highest civilian honor Padama Bhushan by the government of India. Aamir's expansive range of characterizations remains unparalleled amongst his contemporaries. Because of this diversity and his formidable ability to portray different characters believably on screen, he is today regarded not only as one of the biggest stars in Bollywood but also as one of the finest actors in all of Indian Cinema."

    "description": "The son of an insurance underwriter who represented Lloyd's of London in Ceylon, Trevor Wallace Howard-Smith was born in Margate, Kent. He spent his early childhood globetrotting with his mother, frequently left in the care of strangers. After attending private school he went on to study drama at RADA (due to his mother's insistence) and was voted best in his class following a performance in \"Much Ado About Nothing\". Spurning a Hollywood contract with Paramount he acted on the West End stage and with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon from the mid-1930s, specialising in classical plays ranging from \"Hamlet\" and \"Coriolanus\" to \"French without Tears\", by . Howard was initially turned down for military service by both the RAF and the British Army but shortage of manpower led to his being called up in 1940 to serve as a second lieutenant with the Army Signal Corps. However, he neither saw action nor accumulated the illustrious wartime record (including winning the Military Cross) invented for him by his publicists. A 2001 biography by Terence Pettigrew claimed to have unearthed files from his war record which alleged that he was dismissed from service in 1943 due to 'mental instability'. Ironically, on screen, the actor was often cast as solid, unflappable British officers, perhaps reflecting his own personal credo of always feeling best when impersonating someone else. Howard's career in films began quietly with small roles in and . He unexpectedly leapt to stardom in just his third outing as the stoic, decent Dr. Alec Harvey in 's melancholic story of middle-class wartime romance, . Howard's mannered performance perfectly suited the required stiff-upper-lip mood of the film, his intensity and projected integrity more than compensating for his average looks. That 'jolly decent chap' persona continued on in another 'woman's picture', , but Howard soon found his niche in more determined, worldly roles. He later admitted that \"for years I was practically hounded by my first part in Brief Encounter. I loved the film, mind you, but the role wasn't me, at all\" (Ottawa Citizen, February 17 1961). As a screen actor, Howard came of age in crime thrillers and war films, delivering his first genuine tour de force performance as a battle-hardened, cynical ex-pilot caught up in the world of post-war black market racketeering in . His efficient, by-the-book intelligence officer, Major Calloway, in 's put him firmly on the map as a star character player. Rasping-voiced and becoming increasingly craggy as the years went by, Howard contrasted archetypal authoritarians (seasoned army veteran Captain Thomson of , Captain William Bligh in the remake of , Lord Cardigan in ) with weaklings (best exemplified by morally corrupt, degenerate expatriate trader Peter Willems in -- arguably one of Howard's finest performances); sympathetic victims (colonial cop Scobie, tormented by religious guilt in ) and obsessive, driven eccentrics (crusading elephant preservationist Morel in , the alcoholic, haunted , and the weird Russian recluse of ). In the midst of angst-ridden heroes, drunken clerics and assorted historical characters, ranging from Napoleon Bonaparte to Sir Isaac Newton, Howard even essayed a Cheyenne warrior returning from the dead to defend his family in . Remarkably, though he took on a score of eminently forgettable projects, it is difficult to fault a single one of his performances. Throughout his entire career he was never out of favour with audiences and never out of work. As becoming one of the most British of actors, Howard was an ardent cricket supporter, member of the prestigious Marylebone Cricket Club. He insisted on having a clause inserted in his contracts which allowed him leave from filming to attend test matches. A rather solitary man, he had few other hobbies (except, perhaps, a fondness for alcohol, which likely contributed to his death at the age of 74) and was reputedly modest about his accomplishments as an actor. He once declared \"we don't have the Method School of acting in England. We simply read the script, let it seep in, then go put on whiskers - and do it\" (New York Times, January 8 1988)."

Burton was born Richard Walter Jenkins in 1925 into a Welsh (Cymraeg)-speaking family in Pontrhydyfen to Edith Maude (Thomas) and Richard Walter Jenkins, a coal miner. The twelfth of thirteen children, his mother died while he was a toddler and his father later abandoned the family, leaving him to be raised by an elder sister, Cecilia.

His audience appeal began to decline somewhat by the end of the 1960s as fans turned to younger, more virile male stars, however Burton was superb in as King Henry VIII, he put on a reasonable show in the boring , was over the top in the awful , gave sleepwalking performances in and , and was wildly miscast in the ludicrous . By the early 1970s, quality male lead roles were definitely going to other stars, and Burton found himself appearing in some movies of dubious quality, just to pay the bills and support family, including (his last on-screen appearance with Taylor), , , (which was never completed) and . However, he won another Oscar nomination for his excellent performance as a concerned psychiatrist in . He appeared with fellow acting icons and in about mercenaries in South Africa.

His paternal grandparents were from the Isle of Man and Ireland, respectively. He lives with his parents and three younger brothers - Paddy and twins Sam and Harry. Tom attended Donhead Prep School. Then, after a successful eleven plus exam, he became a pupil at Wimbledon College. Having successfully completed his GCSEs, in September 2012 Tom started a two-year course in the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology notable for its numerous famous alumni. Holland began dancing at a hip hop class at Nifty Feet Dance School in Wimbledon, London. His potential was spotted by choreographer Lynne Page (who was an Associate to Peter Darling, choreographer of Billy Elliot and Billy Elliot the Musical) when he performed with his dance school as part of the Richmond Dance Festival 2006. After eight auditions and subsequent two years of training, on 28 June 2008 Tom made his West End debut in Billy Elliot the Musical as Michael, Billy's best friend. He gave his first performance in the title role of Billy on 8 September 2008 getting rave reviews praising his versatile acting and dancing skills. In September 2008 Tom (together with co-star Tanner Pflueger) appeared on the news programme on channel FIVE and gave his first TV interview. In 2009 Tom was featured on ITV1 show \"The Feel Good Factor\". At the launch show on 31 January he and two other Billy Elliots, Tanner Pflueger and Layton Williams, performed a specially choreographered version of Angry Dance from Billy Elliot the Musical, after which Tom was interviewed by host Myleene Klass. Then he became involved into training five ordinary British schoolboys learning to get fit and preparing their dance routine (fronted by Tom) for the final \"The Feel Good Factor\" show on 28 March 2009. On 11 March 2010, Tom, along with fellow Billy Elliots Dean-Charles Chapman and Fox Jackson-Keen appeared on The Alan Titchmarsh Show on ITV1. On 8 March 2010, to mark the fifth anniversary of Billy Elliot the Musical, four current Billy Elliots, including Tom Holland, were invited to 10 Downing Street to meet the Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

In two months after leaving Billy Elliot the Musical, Holland successfully auditioned for a starring role in the film The Impossible (directed by Juan Antonio Bayona) alongside Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor.

The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012, and was released in Europe in October 2012, and in North America in December 2012. Tom has received universal praise for his performance, in particular: \"What a debut, too, from Tom Holland as the eldest of their three lads\" (The Telegraph); \"Tom Holland, making one of the finest feature debuts in years\" (HeyUGuys); \"the excellent Tom Holland\" (The Guardian); \"The child performers are uncanny and there is an especially terrific performance from Tom Holland as the resourceful, levelheaded Lucas terrified but tenacious in the face of an unspeakable ordeal\" (Screen Daily); \"Young Holland in particular is astonishingly good as the terrified but courageous Lucas.\" (The Hollywood Reporter); \"However, the real acting standout in The Impossible is the performance of Tom Holland as the eldest son Lucas. His portrayal is genuine, and at no moment does it feel melodramatic and forced. The majority of his scenes are separate from the lead actors and for the most part it feels like The Impossible is Holland's film\" (Entertainment Maven); \"Mr. Holland, meanwhile, matures before our eyes, navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility. He is a terrific young actor\" (New York Times). Tom has given a number of interviews about his role in The Impossible. In particular, he talked on video to Vanity Fair Senior West Coast editor Krista Smith and with IAMROGUE's Managing Editor Jami Philbrick. He has also given interviews to The Hollywood Reporter, to the MovieWeb, to Today Show on NBC and to other outlets. Tom's director and co-stars have also talked about him. Juan Antonio Bayona: \"He had this extraordinary ability to get into the emotion and portray it in a very, very easy way. The best I'd ever seen in a kid.\" Ewan McGregor: \"It was wonderful watching Tom who had never worked in front of a camera before, to see him really get it and grow as a film actor as he went along. He's really talented and polite to everyone. It's very easy for children to lose perspective but he's absolutely on the right road and a brilliant actor.\" Naomi Watts: \"He has an incredible emotional instrument and an unbelievable sense of himself... Tom Holland and I had a couple of moments where we came together and I could just tell how wonderful he was and what a beautiful instrument he had. It was just easy to work with him, that was one of the greatest highlights for me: discovering a friendship with Tom off-screen and this beautiful relationship between mother and son on-screen. The intimacy that develops through the course of the film between Lucas and Maria, I just loved that relationship. I mean, Tom is a beyond gifted actor. He's just a raw, open talent that is just so easy to work with. And Tom, he's inspiring, he kind of lifts everyone's game around him because he can do nothing but tell the truth. He was great.\" In his turn, Tom Holland has returned favours to Naomi Watts when he was asked to present Desert Palm Achievement Award to her at Palm Springs International Film Festival. According to HitFix: \"One recurring theme of the night was how the introductions were often better than actual winner's speeches... The best intro, however, had to go to 16-year-old Tom Holland who intro'd his \"Impossible\" co-star Watts. Holland admitted of all of Watts' great performances his dad had only let him see \"King Kong\" and while they spent six weeks shooting in a water tank he didn't know it was \"difficult\" because he actually \"loved it\"... Most important, this was Holland's first film role and he sweetly noted, \"From the moment I met you, you took my hand and you never let go.\" Cue the \"awwww\" from the audience.\" The presentation is available on video. In 2011, Holland was cast in British version of the animation film Arrietty, produced by Japan's cult Studio Ghibli. He has provided voice over for the principal character Sho. In 2012 Tom Holland played the starring role of Isaac in the film \"How I lived Now\", (directed by Kevin Macdonald) alongside Saoirse Ronan. The film was released in 2013. On 17 October 2012, Holland became a recipient of Hollywood Spotlight Award for his role in The Impossible. \"We are very excited that we will be able to recognize acting talents that are on the road to discovery and stardom,\" said Carlos de Abreu, founder and executive director of the Hollywood Film Awards in a statement. On 6 December 2012 it was announced that Holland became a winner of the National Board of Review award in the \"Breakthrough Actor\" category. In the end of December 2012, Holland was voted a winner for the year's Best Youth Performance in Nevada Critics Awards. In December 2012, Holland received a number of nominations for his role in The Impossible: for the 18th annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards, in the \"Best Young Acror/Acress\" category; for Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the \"Most Promising Performer\" category; for the 27th Goya Awards in the \"Best New Actor\" category; for the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the \"Best Youth Performance\" category; for the London Film Critics Circle Awards 2012 in the \"Young British Performer of the Year\" category. Kristopher Tapley, Editor-at-Large of HitFix, reported on 27 August 2012 that Summit Entertainment, the company responsible for distribution of The Impossible in USA, would be campaigning Holland rather than McGregor as the lead, and strongly argued that Tom Holland deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Actor category. The fact of long-listing for an Academy Award was confirmed in the article in the Hollywood Reporter: \"And though McGregor stars as his father in the film, Holland has been submitted as the lead actor for awards consideration. Regardless if he receives any nominations, his performance as the strong-willed and determined eldest son is garnering critical acclaim.\" As one of the most promising young actors, Holland was featured in Screen International's \"UK Stars of Tomorrow - 2012\" and in Variety's \"Youth Impact Report 2012\". Holland has been signed up by William Morris Endeavor (WME) global talent agency and is represented by Curtis Brown literary and talent agency. In 2015, Tom was cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in Sony and Marvel's films. He has played the role in , , and ."

    "description": "The words \"suave\" and \"debonair\" became synonymous with the name Adolphe Menjou in Hollywood, both on- and off-camera. The epitome of knavish, continental charm and sartorial opulence, Menjou, complete with trademark waxy black mustache, evolved into one of Hollywood's most distinguished of artists and fashion plates, a tailor-made scene-stealer, if you will. What is often forgotten is that he was primed as a matinÃ©e idol back in the silent-film days. With hooded, slightly owlish eyes, a prominent nose and prematurely receding hairline, he was hardly competition for , but he did possess the requisite demeanor to confidently pull off a roguish and magnetic man-about-town. Fluent in six languages, Menjou was nearly unrecognizable without some type of formal wear, and he went on to earn distinction as the nation's \"best dressed man\" nine times. Born on February 18, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he was christened Adolphe Jean Menjou, the elder son of a hotel manager. His Irish mother was a distant cousin of novelist / poet (\"Ulysses\") (1882-1941). His French father, an Ã©migrÃ©, eventually moved the family to Cleveland, where he operated a chain of restaurants. He disapproved of show business and sent an already piqued Adolphe to Culver Military Academy in Indiana in the hopes of dissuading him from such a seemingly reckless and disreputable career. From there Adolphe was enrolled at Stiles University prep school and then Cornell University. Instead of acquiescing to his father's demands and obtaining a engineering degree, however, he abruptly changed his major to liberal arts and began auditioning for college plays. He left Cornell in his third year in order to help his father manage a restaurant for a time during a family financial crisis. From there he left for New York and a life in the theater. Adolphe toiled as a laborer, a haberdasher and even a waiter in one of his father's restaurants during his salad days, which included some vaudeville work. Oddly enough, he never made it to Broadway but instead found extra and/or bit work for various film studios (Vitagraph, Edison, Biograph) starting in 1915. World War I interrupted his early career, and he served as a captain with the Ambulance Corps in France. After the war he found employment off-camera as a productions manager and unit manager. When the New York-based film industry moved west, so did Adolphe. Nothing of major significance happened for the fledgling actor until 1921, an absolute banner year for him. After six years of struggle he finally broke into the top ranks with substantial roles in and , the latter starring . He formed some very strong connections as a result and earned a Paramount contract in the process. Cast by Mary's then-husband as Louis XIII in the rousing silent , he finished off the year portraying the influential writer/friend Raoul de Saint Hubert in 's classic . Firmly entrenched in the Hollywood lifestyle, it took little time for Menjou to establish his slick prototype as the urbane ladies' man and wealthy rouÃ©. Paramount, noticing how Menjou stole scenes from favorite in Chaplin's , started capitalizing on Menjou's playboy image by casting him as various callous and creaseless matinÃ©e leads in such films as , , , and . His younger brother , a minor actor, had a part in Adolphe's picture . The stock market crash led to the termination of Adolphe's Paramount contract, and his status as leading man ended with it. MGM took him on at half his Paramount salary and his fluency in such languages as French and Spanish kept him employed at the beginning. Rivaling for the attentions of in started the ball rolling for Menjou as a dressy second lead. Rarely placed in leads following this period, he managed his one and only Oscar nomination for \"Best Actor\" with his performance as editor Walter Burns in . Not initially cast in the role, he replaced , who died ten days into rehearsal. Quality parts in quality pictures became the norm for Adolphe during the 1930s, with outstanding roles given him in , , , , , , and . The 1940s were not as golden, however. In addition to entertaining the troops overseas and making assorted broadcasts in a host of different languages, he did manage to get the slick and slimy Billy Flynn lawyer role opposite ' felon in the \"Chicago\" adaptation , and continued to earn occasional distinction in such post-WWII pictures as and . His last lead was in the crackerjack thriller , in which he played an (urbane) San Francisco homicide detective tracking down a killer who preys on women in San Francisco, and he appeared without his mustache for the first time in nearly two decades. Also active on radio and TV, his last notable film was the classic anti-war picture playing the villainous Gen. Broulard. Adolphe's extreme hardcore right-wing Republican politics hurt his later reputation, as he was made a scapegoat for his cooperation as a \"friendly witness\" at the House Un-American Activities Commission hearing during the Red Scare era. Following his last picture, Disney's , in which he played an uncharacteristically rumpled curmudgeon who is charmed by , he retired from acting. He died after a nine-month battle with hepatitis on October 29, 1963, inside his Beverly Hills home. Three times proved the charm for Adolphe with his 1934 marriage to actress , who survived him. The couple had an adopted son named Peter. His autobiography, \"It Took Nine Tailors\" (1947), pretty much says it all for this polished, preening professional."

His father was of Irish ancestry, and his mother was of English and Irish descent. Ryan served in the United States Marines as a drill sergeant (winning a boxing championship) and went on to become a key figure in post WWII American Film Noir and western productions. Ryan grabbed critical attention for his dynamic performances as an anti-Semitic bully in the superb , as an over-the-hill boxer who refuses to take a fall in and as a hostile & jaded cop in . Ryan's athletic physique, intense gaze and sharply delivered, authoritarian tones made him an ideal actor for the oily world of the Film Noir genre, and he contributed solid performances to many Film Noir features, usually as a vile villain. Ryan played a worthy opponent for bounty hunter in the directed western , he locked horns with an intrepid investigator in the suspenseful and starred alongside in the grimy, gangster flick . Plus, the inventive Ryan excelled as the ruthless \"John Claggart\" in , and two different WWII US generals - first in the star-filled and then in . For the next eight years prior to his untimely death in 1973, Ryan landed some tremendous roles in a mixture of productions each aided by his high-caliber acting skills leaving strong impressions on movie audiences. He was one of the hard men hired to pursue kidnapped in the hard boiled action of , a by-the-book army colonel clashing with highly unorthodox army major in , and an embittered bounty hunter (again) forced to hunt down old friend in the violent western classic . Ryan's final on-screen performance was in the terrific production of based on the play and also starring and . Legend has it that clashed very heatedly with Ryan during the making of ; however Peckinpah eventually backed down when a crew member reminded Sam of Robert Ryan's proficiency with his fists! Primarily a man of pacifist beliefs, Ryan often found it a challenge playing sadistic and racist characters who very much were at odds with his own personal ideals. Additionally, Ryan actively campaigned for improved civil rights, restricting the growth of nuclear weapons, and he strongly opposed McCarthyism and its abuse of people who many believed were innocent. A gifted, intelligent and powerful actor, Robert Ryan passed away on July 11th, 1973 of lung cancer."

At thirteen years, he became a member of the \"Hitler Jugend\" (Hitler Youth), as did all 13-year-old boys in Germany then. The purpose of the organization was to prepare the boys for military service. At age 15, Hardy made his film debut in a German picture (), but his acting career was interrupted when he was drafted into the German army in 1944 at age 16 and posted to an infantry regiment. Years later, Hardy related how he \"hated that [Nazi] uniform.\" During the filming of in which he portrayed a Nazi general, he wore a top-coat over his S.S. uniform between takes so as \"not to remind myself of my childhood in Germany during W.W.II.\" It is said that, during his war years, Hardy was captured and taken prisoner by U.S. forces but attempted to escape thrice, the third time successfully. After the war, Hardy returned to acting and, eight years later, was \"discovered\" by foreign film distributor who promptly cast him in three British pictures, practically filmed back-to-back: , and , in which he appeared simply as a foreigner and not a German, as was usually the case. Following the release of these films, Hardy's career took off. Despite anti-German sentiment that still prevailed in postwar Europe, Hardy, described as \"ruggedly handsome\" and a \"blond heartthrob,\" became an international favorite, paving the way to his first American role as co-star with in the Tanganyika-shot wildlife adventure . Hardy was so taken aback by the beauty of the land, that he bought the film's location (\"Momilla Farm\") and built a small home for himself and a small bungalow hotel for tourists to see the animals. Hunting was forbidden on the property, and, later, a cattle farm was started with the meat being sold to local hotels. Hardy described his home there as \"a sort of African Walden where I can get away from the world from time to time.\" In 1979, due to the dissolution of the alliance of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania (formerly Tanganyika), the border with Kenya was closed and remained so for half a decade which caused a serious decline in tourism. The business aspects of his property were shut down for a period of time, but eventually things picked up and the place was transformed into a proper tourist hotel known (fittingly) as Hatari Lodge. Fluent in English, French. and German, Hardy found himself in much demand by British, French, American and German producers and became more selective in his scripts. \"I'd rather sit out a picture than take a role I don't think is right for me\" he would later say. He died in January 2022 in Palm Springs, California, 11 years after his last film credit."

Milland was born Alfred Reginald Jones in the Welsh town of Neath, Glamorgan, to Elizabeth Annie (Truscott) and Alfred Jones. He spent his youth in the pursuit of sports. He became an expert rider early on, working at his uncle's horse-breeding estate while studying at the King's College in Cardiff. At 21, he went to London as a member of the elite Household Cavalry (Guard for the Royal Family), undergoing a rigorous 19-months training, further honing his equestrian skills, as well as becoming adept at fencing, boxing and shooting. He won trophies, including the Bisley Match, with his unit's crack rifle team. However, after four years, he suddenly lost his means of financial support (independent income being a requirement as a Guardsman) when his stepfather discontinued his allowance. Broke, he tried his hand at acting in small parts on the London stage. There are several stories as to how he derived his stage name. It is known, that during his teens he called himself \"Mullane\", using his stepfather's surname. He may later have suffused \"Mullane\" with \"mill-lands\", an area near his hometown. When he first appeared on screen in British films, he was billed first as Spike Milland, then Raymond Milland. In 1929, Ray befriended the popular actress at a party and, later that year, visited her on the set of her latest film, . While having lunch, they were joined by a producer who persuaded the handsome Welshman to appear in a motion picture bit part. Ray rose to the challenge and bigger roles followed, including the male lead in . The following year, he was signed by MGM and went to Hollywood, but was given little to work with, except for the role of 's ill-fated nephew in . After a year, Ray was out of his contract and returned to England. His big break did not come until 1934 when he joined Paramount, where he was to remain for the better part of his Hollywood career. During the first few years, he served an apprenticeship playing second leads, usually as the debonair man-about-town, in light romantic comedies. He appeared with Burns and Allen in , enjoyed third-billing as a British aristocrat in the farce and was described as \"excellent\" by reviewers for his role in the sentimental drama . By 1936, he had graduated to starring roles, first as the injured British hunter rescued on a tropical island by , the film which launched 's sarong-clad career. After that, he was the titular hero of and, finally, won the girl (rather than being the \"other man\") in 's screwball comedy . He also re-visited the tropics in , and , as well as being one of the three valiant brothers of . In 1940, Ray was sent back to England to star in the screen adaptation of 's , for which he received his best critical reviews to date. He was top-billed (above ) running a ship salvage operation in 's lavish Technicolor adventure drama , besting Wayne in a fight - much to the \"Duke's\" personal chagrin - and later wrestling with a giant octopus. Also that year, he was directed by in a charming comedy, (co-starred with ), for which he garnered good notices from of the New York Times. Ray then played a ghost hunter in , and the suave hero caught in a web of espionage in 's thriller . On the strength of his previous role as \"Major Kirby\", chose to cast Ray against type in the ground-breaking drama as dipsomaniac writer \"Don Birnam\". Ray gave the defining performance of his career, his intensity catching critics, used to him as a lightweight leading man, by surprise. Crowther commented \"Mr. Milland, in a splendid performance, catches all the ugly nature of a 'drunk', yet reveals the inner torment and degradation of a respectable man who knows his weakness and his shame\" (New York Times, December 3, 1945). Arrived at the high point of his career, Ray Milland won the Oscar for Best Actor, as well as the New York Critic's Award. Rarely given such good material again, he nonetheless featured memorably in many more splendid films, often exploiting the newly discovered \"darker side\" of his personality: as the reporter framed for murder by 's heinous publishing magnate in ; as the sophisticated, manipulating art thief \"Mark Bellis\" in the Victorian melodrama (for which producer sent him back to England); as a Fedora-wearing, Armani-suited \"Lucifer\", trawling for the soul of an honest District Attorney in ; and as a traitorous scientist in , giving what critics described as a \"sensitive\" and \"towering\" performance. In 1954, Ray played calculating ex-tennis champ \"Tony Wendice\", who blackmails a former Cambridge chump into murdering his wife, in 's . He played the part with urbane sophistication and cold detachment throughout, even in the scene of denouement, calmly offering a drink to the arresting officers. With , Ray Milland moved into another direction, turning out several off-beat, low-budget films with himself as the lead, notably , and . At the same time, he cheerfully made the transition to character parts, often in horror and sci-fi outings. In accordance with his own dictum of appearing in anything that had \"any originality\", he worked on two notable pictures with : first, as a man obsessed with catalepsy in ; secondly, as obsessed self-destructive surgeon \"Dr. Xavier\" in -the Man with X-Ray Eyes, a film which, despite its low budget, won the 1963 Golden Asteroid in the Trieste Festival for Science Fiction. As the years went on, Ray gradually disposed of his long-standing toupee, lending dignity through his presence to many run-of-the-mill television films, such as and maudlin melodramas like . He guest-starred in many anthology series on television and had notable roles in 's and the original (as Quorum member Sire Uri). He also enjoyed a brief run on Broadway, starring as \"Simon Crawford\" in \"Hostile Witness\" (1966), at the Music Box Theatre. In his private life, Ray was an enthusiastic yachtsman, who loved fishing and collecting information by reading the Encyclopedia Brittanica. In later years, he became very popular with interviewers because of his candid spontaneity and humour. In the same self-deprecating vein he wrote an anecdotal biography, \"Wide-Eyed in Babylon\", in 1976. A film star, as well as an outstanding actor, Ray Milland died of cancer at the age of 79 in March 1986."

He began taking piano lessons and got into the Santander Music Conservatory, where he studied for five years. His music professors discovered that he had many conditions for playing piano, so they would keep him practicing for hours until he got tired of it and quit. After finishing high school, he decided to become a lawyer and majored at University of Santander, one of the most prestigious universities in Europe.That wouldn't last long either, because he got the acting bug by chance when attended an acting class alongside a friend that wanted to be an actress, he was invited to participate and enjoyed it enough to do that for living.

Ustinov had ancestral connections to Russian nobility as well as to the Ethiopian Royal Family. His father, also known as \"Klop Ustinov\", was a pilot in the German Air Force during World War I. In 1919, Jona Freiherr von Ustinow joined his own mother and sister in St Petersburg, Russia, where he met his future wife, artist , who worked for the Imperial Mariinsky Ballet and Opera House in St Petersburg. In 1920, in a modest and discreet ceremony at a Russian-German church in St Petersburg, Ustinov's father married Nadia. In February 1921, when she was seven months pregnant with Peter, the couple emigrated from Russia in the aftermath of the Communist Revolution. Young Peter was brought up in a multilingual family. He was fluent in Russian, French, Italian and German, as well as English.

    "description": "Exotic leading man of American films, famed as much for his completely bald head as for his performances, Yul Brynner masked much of his life in mystery and outright lies designed to tease people he considered gullible. It was not until the publication of the books \"Yul: The Man Who Would Be King\" and \"Empire and Odyssey\" by his son, Yul \"Rock\" Brynner, that many of the details of Brynner's early life became clear. Yul sometimes claimed to be a half-Swiss, half-Japanese named Taidje Khan, born on the island of Sakhalin; in reality, he was the son of Marousia Dimitrievna (Blagovidova), the Russian daughter of a doctor, and Boris Yuliyevich Bryner, an engineer and inventor of Swiss-German and Russian descent. He was born in their home town of Vladivostok on 11 July 1920 and named Yuli after his grandfather, Jules Bryner. When Yuli's father abandoned the family, his mother took him and his sister Vera to Harbin, Manchuria, where they attended a YMCA school. In 1934 Yuli's mother took her children to Paris. Her son was sent to the exclusive LycÃ©e Moncelle, but his attendance was spotty. He dropped out and became a musician, playing guitar in the nightclubs among the Russian gypsies who gave him his first real sense of family. He met luminaries such as and became an apprentice at the Theatre des Mathurins. He worked as a trapeze artist with the famed Cirque d'Hiver company. He traveled to the U.S. in 1941 to study with acting teacher and toured the country with Chekhov's theatrical troupe. That same year, he debuted in New York as Fabian in \"Twelfth Night\" (billed as Youl Bryner). After working in a very early TV series, , he played on Broadway in \"Lute Song\" with , winning awards and mild acclaim. He and his wife, actress , starred in the first TV talk show, . Brynner then joined CBS as a television director. He made his film debut in . Two years later Mary Martin recommended him for the part he would forever be known for: the King in ' and 's musical \"The King and I\". Brynner became an immediate sensation in the role, repeating it for film () and winning the Oscar for Best Actor. For the next two decades, he maintained a starring film career despite the exotic nature of his persona, performing in a wide range of roles from Egyptian pharaohs to Western gunfighters, almost all with the same shaved head and indefinable accent. In the 1970s he returned to the role that had made him a star, and spent most of the rest of his life touring the world in \"The King and I\". When he developed lung cancer in the mid 1980s, he left a powerful public service announcement denouncing smoking as the cause, for broadcast after his death. The cancer and its complications, after a long illness, ended his life. Brynner was cremated and his ashes buried in a remote part of France, on the grounds of the Abbey of Saint-Michel de Bois Aubry, a short distance outside the village of LuzÃ©. He remains one of the most fascinating, unusual and beloved stars of his time."

Mickey was performing, playing in a band in Cleveland, Ohio, which is where Joel Grey was born. Musician and bandleader Spike Jones needed a clarinet player who could do bits, funny things. Mickey went on the road with Jones' band for about a year, the Katz family ending up, as the band all went to California. One day his father Mickey was doing a recording session at the Sunset Boulevard RCA-Victor recording studio in Hollywood, and during a break, Mickey always wrote parodies to pop songs for fun and had just written this parody -- he was singing it to one of the other Jewish musicians. Unbeknownst to him the microphone was open in the control room and this group of non-Jewish, white-bread heads of RCA-Victor were sitting there and he's singing a Yiddish song. They didn't know what he was singing but they were laughing and laughing and they decided to record it. The recording became an enormous hit. The records were so successful Mickey put together a variety show that sold out every week in Los Angeles at the Wilshire Ebell Theater. Joel knew, even at 9, that he was going to become an actor. When his father had this variety show, Joel said, \"How can I be in it?\" And his father said, \"Well, what do you want to do?\" Joel replied, \"I don't know how to sing and I don't dance, but I'll run around and I'll move.\" So Joel's aunt dropped him a song that was a big record in New York, a Yiddish song -- it was a million words and very fast and it was very popular with the audience -- and Joel learned it by rote. Joel had no idea what he was saying or singing and the next thing he knew, he was boxed in to being a song-and-dance man as opposed to an actor. \"Romania, Romania.\" The song was like a Danny Kaye spectacular, fast, patter song that left a lot of room to dance and sing and mug and do all the things like his hero at the time -- Jerry Lewis. Maybe two years, Eddie Cantor saw Joel in Florida and put him on his \"Colgate Comedy Hour' television show, and that was the end of the \"Borscht Capades\" for Joel, and the beginning of Joel's long tenure in night clubs all over the country."

    "description": "A remarkably seasoned actor of stage, screen and television, Darren McGavin has notched in excess of 200 performances; however, he is most fondly remembered by cult TV fans as heroic newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak in the classic but short-lived horror TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker (1974). In a long and varied career, McGavin has often turned up as authority figures including policemen, military officers, stern-faced business executives or father figures; however, he is equally adept at light-hearted comedic performances. Darren McGavin was born William Lyle Richardson on May 7, 1922, in Spokane, Washington, to Grace Mitton (Bogart) and Reed D. Richardson. His mother was from Ontario, Canada. He received his dramatic arts training at New York's Neighborhood Playhouse and the Actors Studio, and debuted on screen in an uncredited role in . Several standard roles followed over the next decade before he landed the key role of Louie the drug pusher in and Capt. Russ Peters in , both directed by . Each of these performances showcased McGavin's versatility, and his virile looks scored him the role of 's hard-boiled private eye in . McGavin stayed continually employed throughout the 1960s, appearing in such films as , , and . In addition, he was regularly guest-starring in dozens of TV shows, including , , and . In 1971 he landed the role of cynical reporter Carl Kolchak in the low-budget horror thriller , about a vampire running amok in Las Vegas. The film was a monster ratings winner (pun intended!) and the highest-rated telemovie of 1972, and original scriptwriters were soon hard at work on a punchier sequel. saw Kolchak in Seattle (after being booted out of Las Vegas by the police), and this time on the trail of a serial killer seeking the elixir of eternal youth. The second movie was equally successful, and spawned the short-lived TV series with as McGavin's long-suffering editor and a host of weekly guest stars including , , , , and . \"Kolchak\" only lasted one season, but it became a bona-fide cult classic, and many years later its premise of \"the unknown amongst us\" inspired writer to create the phenomenally successful long-running TV series , which saw McGavin guest-star in several episodes. McGavin remained busy throughout the rest of the 1970s and into the 1980s, appearing in , as Gen. in the TV miniseries , alongside in the uneven sci-fi miniseries and a few years later endeared himself to to a whole new generation of fans with his superb performance as the vitriolic, yet buffoonish, father in the delightful Christmas classic . The always versatile McGavin also popped up as a detective in , assisted in cleaning up the mob in and was a doctor in the bizarre zombie/cop/zombie cop film . At this point it's worth mentioning that, along with his film and TV work, McGavin has also enjoyed an illustrious career on the stage, with appearances in dozens of critically acclaimed productions across the length and breadth of the US. He has appeared in stage presentations of \"Death of a Salesman\", \"The Rainmaker\", \"The King and I\" and \"Blood Sweat & Stanley Poole\", to name a few. In 1990 the opportunity arose for McGavin to play another somewhat stern, yet comedic, father figure, this time as \"Bill Brown\" to in the much loved sitcom . McGavin was again wonderful, and his entertaining performances resulted in an Emmy Award nomination in 1990. Several other film roles followed in the 1990s, in such films as 's hit . He died on 25th February 2006 at the age of 83."

    "description": "John Belushi was born in Chicago, Illinois, USA, on January 24, 1949, to Agnes Demetri (Samaras) and Adam Anastos Belushi, a restaurant owner. His father was an Albanian immigrant, from QytezÃ«, and his mother was also of Albanian descent. He grew up in Wheaton, where the family moved when he was six. Though a young hellion in grade school, John became the perfect all-American boy during his high school years where he was co-captain of the Wheaton Central High School football team and was elected homecoming king his senior year. He also developed an interest in acting and appeared in the high school variety show. Encouraged by his drama teacher, John decided to put aside his plans to become a football coach to pursue a career in acting. After graduation in 1967, John performed in summer stock in rural Indiana in a variety of roles from \"Cardinal Wolsey\" in \"Anne of a Thousand Days\" to a comic detective in \"Ten Little Indians\". In the fall of his freshman year at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater, John changed his image into a bad-boy appearance by growing his hair long and began to have problems with discipline and structure of attending classes. Dropping out of Wisconsin, John spent the next two years at the College of DuPage, a junior college a few miles from his parents' Wheaton home, where his father began persuading him to become a partner in his restaurant, but John still preferred acting. While attending DuPage, John helped found the \"West Compass Players\", an improv comedy troupe patterned after Chicago's famous \"Second City\" ensemble. In 1971, John made the leap to \"Second City\" itself where he performed in various on-stage comic performances with others, who included and . John loved his life at \"Second City\" where he performed six nights a week, perfecting the physical \"gonzo\" style of comedy he later made famous. A year later, John and his live-in girlfriend from his high school years, , moved to New York because John had joined the cast of National Lampoon's Lemmings, an off-Broadway rock musical revue that was originally booked for a six-week run but played to full crowds for nearly 10 months. In 1973, John was hired as a writer for the syndicated National Lampoon's Radio Hour which became the National Lampoon Show in 1975. John's big break came that same year when he joined the ground-breaking TV variety series which made him a star. The unpredictable, aggressively physical style of humor that he began on \"Second City\" flowered on SNL. In 1978, while still working on , John appeared in the movie which starred and was directed by . It was here that director noticed John and decided to cast him in his movie National Lampoon's . John's minor role as the notorious, beer-swilling \"Bluto\" made it a box-office smash and the year's top grossing comedy. Despite appearing in only a dozen scenes, John's performance stole the movie, which portrays college fraternity shenanigans at a small college set in the year 1962. In 1979, John along with fellow SNL regular quit the series to pursue movie projects. John and appeared in minor roles in 's financially unsuccessful and, the following year, in ' . Around this time, John's drug use began escalating. Cocaine, which was ubiquitous in show-business circles in the 1970's, became his drug of choice. After he first experimented with cocaine in the mid 1970s, John almost immediately became addicted to it. His frequent cocaine sniffing binges became a source of friction between him and Judy, whom he married in 1976. John's love for blues and soul music inspired the \"Blues Brothers\". He and Aykroyd first appeared as Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, a pair of white soul men dressed in black suits, skinny ties, fedora hats and Rayban sunglasses, as a warm-up act before the telecasts of . Building on the success of their acts and the release of their album \"A Briefcase Full of Blues\", John and starred in the movie, which gave John a chance to act with his favorite musical heroes including , and . Although John's reputation for being an off-screen party animal is legendary, his generous side is less well known. Using some of his money, he bought his father a ranch outside San Diego for him to live. John helped set up some of his Chicago friends with their own businesses and even financially helped his younger brother, , who followed his older brother's path to both \"Second City\" and . In 1981, John appeared in the movie , playing a hard-nosed Chicago newspaperman who finds romance in Colorado with eagle expert . That same year, John and appeared again in the movie , which gave them a chance to reverse roles, with John playing a straight-arrow family man whose life is turned upside down when a wild family man (Aykroyd) moves in next door. In January 1982, John began work on the screenplay for another movie to be titled \"Noble Rot\". Also, John had checked into a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont, a popular celebrity hotel in Los Angeles. John's drug use had been steadily increasing for over a year now, which alarmed his wife and friends, but he continued to promise Judy that he would quit someday. On March 5, 1982, John Belushi was found dead in his hotel room at the age of 33. The local coroner gave the cause of death as a lethal injection of cocaine and heroin. Several years later, John's drug dealing/drug user companion during his final weeks, , was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for supplying John with the drugs. Close friend sang \"That Lonesome Road\" at a memorial service at Martha's Vineyard cemetery where John was buried."

    "description": "Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain's most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the \"Harry Potter\" franchise. Coltrane was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His mother, Jean Ross (Howie), was a teacher and pianist. His father, Ian Baxter McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad's books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from \"Henry V\". At that time he was fascinated with and . He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh's Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled \"Young Mental Health\", which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh's renowned Traverse Theatre. In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as \"Border Guard\" in BBC's mini-series , then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in .

In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane's barn. In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series .

Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' films. In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, \"Coltrane in a Cadillac\", and also starred in the eponymous TV series, , in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York.

    "description": "A classical actor (and founding member in 1960 of the Royal Shakespeare Company), Richardson earned international fame as the villainous Francis Urquart in the BBC television trilogy, \"House of Cards.\" Uttered in a cut-glass accent, the Machiavellian Prime Minister's sly \"You might well think that ... I couldn't possibly comment\" became a catchphrase when the series was broadcast in the 1990s. Richardson's contributions to his art were honored in 1989 when he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE.) Fittingly, his family had his ashes buried beneath the auditorium of the new Royal Shakespeare theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. Born the son of John and Margaret (Drummond) Richardson on April 7, 1934, he was educated at Tynecastle School in Edinburgh, and studied for the stage at the College of Dramatic Art in Glasgow, where he was awarded the James Bridie Gold Medal in 1957. He joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Company a year later where he played Hamlet as well as John Worthing in \"The Importance of being Earnest.\" In 1960 he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (then called the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre) and drew excellent notices for his work in \"The Merchant of Venice,\" \"Twelfth Night,\" \"The Winter's Tale,\" \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" \"The Comedy of Errors\" and \"King Lear\", among others. In 1964 Richardson played the role of the Herald before advancing to the title role of Jean-Paul Marat in the stunning, avant-garde RSC production of \"Marat-Sade\". In addition, he made his Broadway debut in said role at the very end of 1965, and recreated it to critical acclaim in ' film adaptation with as murderess Charlotte Corday. Richardson also went on to replay Oberon in a lukewarm film version of RSC's that nevertheless bore an elite company of Britain's finest pre-Dames -- , and . One of his lower film points during that time period, however, was appearing in the huge musical movie misfire in the role of the Padre opposite and . Richardson was never far from the Shakespearean stage after his induction into films with majestic portraits of Coriolanus, Pericles, Richard II, Richard III, Cassius (\"Julius Caesar\"), Malcolm (\"Macbeth\"), Angelo (\"Measure for Measure\"), Prospero (\"The Tempest\") and Mercutio (\"Romeo and \"Juliet\") paving the way. Elsewhere on Broadway he received a Drama Desk Award and Tony nomination for his splendid Henry Higgins in a revival of \"My Fair Lady\" in 1976, and was part of the cast of the short-lived (12 performances) production of \"Lolita\" (1981), written by and starring as Humbert Humbert. Customary of many talented Scots, Richardson would find his best on-camera roles in plush, intelligent TV mini-series. On the Shakespearean front he appeared in TV adaptations of , and . After delivering highly capable performances as Field-Marshal Montgomery in both and , Sherlock Holmes in , and Indian Prime Minister Nehru in , he capped his small-screen career in the role of the immoral politician Francis Urquhart in a trio of dramatic satires: , and . His impeccably finely-tuned villain became one his best remembered roles. Filmwise, Richardson's stature did not grow despite polished work in , , , , , and the lightweight mainstream fare and . He appeared less and less on stage in his later years. He took his final stage bows in 2006 with West End productions of \"The Creeper\" and \"The Alchemist\". The urbane 72-year-old actor died unexpectedly in his sleep at his London abode on February 9, 2007, survived by his widow (his wife from 1961 and an RSC actress who played an asylum inmate alongside him in \"Marat-Sade\") and two sons, one of whom, , has been a resident performer with the RSC."

While attending Marquette Academy, he and classmate Pat O'Brien quit school to enlist in the Navy at the start of World War I. Tracy was still at Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia at the end of the war. After playing the lead in the play \"The Truth\" at Ripon College he decided that acting might be his career. Moving to New York, Tracy and O'Brien, who'd also settled on a career on the stage, roomed together while attending the Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1923 both got nonspeaking parts as robots in \"R.U.R.\", a dramatization of the groundbreaking science fiction novel by Czech author Karel Capek. Making very little money in stock, Tracy supported himself with jobs as bellhop, janitor and salesman until saw his critically acclaimed performance in the lead role in the play \"The Last Mile\" (later played on film by Clark Gable) and signed him for The William Fox Film Company's production of . Despite appearing in sixteen films at that studio over the next five years, Tracy was never able to rise to full film star status there, in large part because the studio was unable to match his talents to suitable story material. During that period the studio itself floundered, eventually merging with , Joseph Schenck and William Goetz's William 20th Century Pictures to become 20th Century-Fox). In 1935 Tracy signed with MGM under the aegis of and his career flourished. He became the first actor to win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars for and, in a project he initially didn't want to star in, . During Tracy's nearly forty-year film career, he was nominated for his performances in , , , , , , and . Tracy had a brief romantic relationship with in the mid-1930s, and a lifelong one with beginning in 1942 after they were first paired in Woman of the Year by director George Stevens. Tracy's strong Roman Catholic beliefs precluded his divorcing wife Louise, though they mostly lived apart. Tracy suffered from severe alcoholism and diabetes (from the late 1940s), which led to his declining several tailor-made roles in films that would become big hits with other actors in those roles. Although his drinking problems were well known, he was considered peerless among his colleagues (Tracy had a well-deserved reputation for keeping co-stars on their toes for his oddly endearing scene-stealing tricks), and remained in demand as a senior statesman who nevertheless retained box office clout. Two weeks after completion of 's , during which he suffered from lung congestion, Spencer Tracy died of a heart attack."

Whether by his own design or not, the boyishness that marked his first steps into showbiz has evolved into a cool, somewhat reticent demeanor that has now become his trademark. Despite being effortlessly good-looking, he chooses to strike a sometimes uneasy balance between the commercially pleasing and the quirky in his choice of film roles -- a move that's unusual for Asian leading men. But whether he's the faithful lover in the Japanese AIDS drama , the canned-pineapple-eating cop in or awkward in his role in , a remake of 's , Asian audiences love his style. Other memorable roles include his turn as a lovelorn student in , an angel in and the leader of a trio of robbers in . There hasn't been an Asian actor quite as versatile as Kaneshiro, who is able to straddle the Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japanese film industries because of his proficiency in various languages. Still, one wonders if the reason why he's so sought after is because he is so elusive. No one really knows what he does outside of film commitments, and his reluctance towards being in the spotlight is legendary."

Alhough it was not his first film role, his portrayal of the bipolar numbers boss West Indian Archie in Spike Lee's Malcolm X (1992) is what first attracted attention to Lindo's considerable talents. Since then, his star has slowly been on the rise. The son of Jamaican parents, Lindo was born and raised in Lewisham, England, United Kingdom, until his teens when he and his mother, a nurse, moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. A little later, they moved to the United States, where Lindo would graduate from the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. After graduation, Lindo landed his first film role, that of an Army sergeant in . However, he did not appear in another film for ten years. In the meantime, Lindo worked on stage and, in 1982, debuted on Broadway in \"Master Harold and the Boys\" directed by the play's author, . In 1988, Lindo earned a Tony nomination for his portrayal of Harald Loomis in Joe Turner's Come and Gone. Though he was obviously a talented actor with a bright future, Lindo's career stalled. Wanting someone more aggressive and appreciative of his talents, Lindo changed agents (he'd had the same one through most of his early career). It was a smart move, but it was director who provided the boost Lindo's career needed. The director was impressed enough with Lindo to cast him as patriarch Woody Carmichael in Lee's semi-autobiographical comedy . For Lindo, 1996 was a big year. He landed major supporting roles in six features, including a heavy in 's , another villainous supporting role in Lee's , and still another bad guy in . Lest one believe that Lindo is typecast into forever playing drug lords and gangsters, that year he also played baseball player Leroy \"Satchel\" Paige in the upbeat (a.k.a.

In the tradition set forth in the 1970s by such icons as director Martin Scorsese and actors Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, John Cazale and Joe Pesci, Palminteri has brought grit, muscle and an evocative realism to the sidewalks of his New York neighborhood, violent as they are and were. Chazz was born Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri in 1952 in the Bronx, New York, the son of Rose, a homemaker, and Lorenzo Palminteri, a bus driver. He grew up in a tough area of the Bronx, giving him the life lessons that would later prove very useful to his career. He graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School and started out pursuing his craft in 1973 studying at the Actor's Studio. He appeared off-Broadway in the early 1980s while paying his dues as a bouncer and doorman in nightclubs, among other jobs. In 1986 he headed west and found that his ethnic qualifications was well-suited for getting tough-talker parts. Slick attorneys, unflinching hoods and hard-nosed cops were all part of his ethnic streetwise persona in such TV shows as , and . In films he started off playing a 1930s-style gangster in 's . Although his roles were sharp, well-acted and with a distinct edge to them, there was nothing in them to show that he was capable of stronger leading parts. In 1988 he wrote for himself a play entitled \"A Bronx Tale,\" a powerful one-man stage commentary in which he depicted his bruising childhood in great detail, which included witnessing gangland slayings. Palminteri brought each and every character to life (18 in all) in this autobiographical piece -- his friends, enemies, even his own family. He showcased for years in both Los Angeles and New York, finally sparking the interest of his film idol, . DeNiro, wanting to direct for the first time, saw the potential of this project and brought both it and the actor/writer to the screen. Palminteri played one of the flashier roles, Sonny, a gangster, in the movie version. An unknown film commodity at the time, Chazz had stubbornly refused to sell his stage property (the offers went into the seven figures) unless he was part of the package as both actor and screenwriter. DeNiro, who became his mentor, backed him up all the way, and the rest is history. , which featured his actress/producer/wife , earned strong reviews.

    "description": "American actor Lee Marvin was born Lamont Waltman Marvin Jr. in New York City. After leaving school aged 18, Marvin enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in August 1942. He served with the 4th Marine Division in the Pacific Theater during World War II and after being wounded in action and spending a year being treated in naval hospitals, he received a medical discharge. Marvin's military decorations include the Purple Heart Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal and the Combat Action Ribbon. Returning to the United States it was while working as a plumbers apprentice, repairing a toilet at a local community theater, that he was asked to stand in for an actor who had fallen ill during rehearsals. He immediately caught the acting bug, moving to Greenwich Village to study at the American Theater Wing and began making appearances in stage productions and TV shows. His film debut came in 'You're in the Navy Now' (1951) but it was his portrayal of villains in 'The Big Heat' (1953) and 'The Wild One' (1953) that brought him to the attention of the public and critical acclaim. Now firmly established as a screen bad guy, he began shifting towards leading man roles and landed the lead role in the popular TV series 'M Squad' (1957-1960). Returning to feature films, Marvin had prominent roles in 'The Comancheros' (1961), 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' (1962), 'Donovan's Reef' (1963) and 'The Killers' (1964) but it was his dual comic role in the offbeat western 'Cat Ballou' (1965) that made him a star and won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. He was now a much sought-after actor and starred in a number of movies as a new kind of leading man including 'The Professionals' (1966), 'The Dirty Dozen' (1967), 'Point Blank' (1967), 'Hell in the Pacific' (1968), 'Monte Walsh' (1970), 'Prime Cut' (1972), 'Emperor of the North' (1973) and 'The Spikes Gang' (1974).Later film credits include 'Shout at the Devil' (1976), 'Avalanche Express' (1979), 'The Big Red One' (1980), 'Death Hunt' (1981) and 'Gorky Park' (1983). His final film role was alongside Chuck Norris in 'The Delta Force' (1986). Lee Marvin died of a heart attack in August 1987. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. Marvin paved the way for leading men that didn't fit the traditional mould. An iconic American tough guy and one of the 20th Century's greatest Hollywood stars."

He was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Russia, USSR, to a Jewish family. His parents, Irina Korina and Viktor Yelchin, were a successful pair of professional figure skaters in Leningrad, and his grandfather was also a professional sportsman, a soccer player. Anton was a six-month-old baby when he immigrated to the United States, where his parents settled in California and eventually developed coaching careers. He demonstrated his strong personality from the early age of four, and declined his parents' tutelage in figure skating because he was fond of acting and knew exactly what he wanted to do in his life. Yelchin attended acting classes in Los Angeles, and eventually was noticed by casting agents. In 2000, at the age of 10, he made his debut on television, appearing as Robbie Edelstein in the medical drama . At the age of 11, he shot to fame as Bobby Garfield, co-starring opposite in , and earning himself the 2002 Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film as Leading Young Actor. Over the course of his acting career, Yelchin has already played roles in more than 20 feature films and television productions, including Pavel Chekov in the hugely successful reboot , and its sequel, . Outside of his acting profession, Anton loved reading, and was also fond of playing chess. He wrote music and performed with a band, where he also played piano and guitar. Anton lived in Los Angeles, California, until his death on the evening of June 19, 2016, outside his LA home, when his parked Jeep Grand Cherokee rolled backward on his steep driveway, pinning him against a brick pillar and security fence. This was due to badly designed shifter that indicated park when it was in neutral. This death, along with reports of other near-misses, resulted in a recall of that model."

    "description": "Johan Heldenbergh (55) grew up in Gent (Belgium) dreaming of being a movie director and actor, but he was converted to theatre in the late eighties, during his education in the prestigious Studio Herman Teirlinck acting school in Antwerp. The fact that Flanders didn't have a real, or interesting movie and television culture at the time and the freedom he found as a theatre actor, persuaded him to follow that path, enjoying the independence and creativity contemporary Flemish theatre had to offer. He worked as an actor for Alain Platel, Luc Perceval, Raven Ruell, Arne Sierens.a.o. He started writing and directing in 2001. In 2005 he founded \"Compagnie Cecilia\" together with Arne Sierens and Marijke Pinoy. His plays \"Massis the musical\" and especially \"The Broken circle breakdown\" have become landmarks in Flemish theatre history. His major themes are suicide, political, social, and religious commentaries. His true vocation has always been cinema, but it wasn't until he met Felix Van Groeningen for his first movie \"Steve and Skye\", that he started to consider engaging himself in Belgian cinema, and combining the two, playing a character in a movie every summer. His collaboration with Felix Van Groeningen continued for \"De helaasheid der dingen/La merditude des choses\", that was selected for \"La quinzaine des realisateurs\" in Cannes, and especially for the adaptation of his own play \"The Broken Circle Breakdown/Alabama Monroe\" that received an Oscar nomination, a EFA nomination, and the Cesar for best foreign language in 2014. Since then he is a regular actor in French and international movies and television series. He starred with Jessica Chastain in \"The zookeepers wife\" (2017), with Hilary Swank and Helena Bonham Carter in \"55 Steps\" and with Jesse Eisenberg and Alexander Skarsgard in \"The hummingbird project\". He played \"Kolonel Karremans\" in \"Quo Vadis Aida\" which was nominated in 2021. In 2009 he started a community project in the village where he lived for 13 years. 600 nonprofessionals collaborated on a movie he wrote and directed, called \"Schellebelle 1919\". Although the priority has always been on the social aspect of the project, the movie succeeded in getting a professional distribution, and got the first \"Ensor for special merit\" the flemish academy issued every year since then. He plays the five-string banjo, mandolin, and acoustic guitar. He tapdances and has four children."

    "description": "From a talented acting generation of four brothers, Timothy Bottoms was the closest to achieving out-and-out super-stardom in the 1970s. The eldest of four siblings, he was followed in birth by Joseph Bottoms, Sam Bottoms and Ben Bottoms. All four boys were born and raised in Santa Barbara, California, with Timothy James birth date being August 30, 1951. As the children of James \"Bud\" Bottoms, a sculptor and high school art teacher, and his wife Betty, artistic expression was certainly encouraged in this family and Timothy expressed an avid interest, even during his preschool years, of wanting to perform. He was a local member of the Youth Theater Productions at school and in 1967 toured Europe along with the Santa Barbara Madrigal Society, which sealed his aspirations. Following high school, Timothy was spotted by Universal in a stage production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" and chosen (with no prior film experience) for a lead part in director 's . As Joe, a young American soldier who is shelled and left armless and legless on the last day of World War I, Timothy received excellent reviews and earned a Golden Globe nomination as \"Most Promising Newcomer.\" His next starring role propelled him into the top leagues. Cast as aimless Texas-boy \"Sonny,\" the sensitive, mournful-eyed, youthful focus of 's downbeat Oscar winner , the film went on to make full-fledged stars not only of Timothy, but of and . Younger brother Sam, who frequently visited the set, wound up touchingly cast as simple, naive, ill-fated character. The early 1970s was a time of great personal accomplishments for Timothy in film. Engagingly maladroit and looking slightly uncomfortable in his own skin, he proved that his first reviews were no flukes. He appeared to great advantage in the touching drama opposite British acting doyenne and as the tousle-haired college protagonist in the coming-of-age box-office hit . In an effort to break free of his sensitive prototype, he delved into stranger, darker characters with and . These efforts were less successful, however, and he quickly began to discover his film career slipping away at the early age of 26. Outgrowing his awkward adorableness, he shifted to the smaller screen in order to secure challenging roles, such as the biblical lead in ; his ex-convict in ; his bank teller in ; his fatally-stricken track runner in , and the role (in which he aged 30 years) in the ambitious mini-series , with brother Sam recreating the part. Timothy's success certainly encouraged his younger siblings. By this time Joseph, Sam and Ben were were all experiencing significant lifts in their own respective careers. As a group, the four brothers hooked up together for the TV movie , in which they all played brothers and used their real first names. The movie was promoted as a pilot for an upcoming weekly series, but it failed to make the grade. While Timothy continued to work steadily throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the quality of material he was given grew more standard. Roles in such films as , and the foreign-made did little to reignite his earlier success. A sequel to his famous \"The Last Picture Show\", entitled , could have had heads turning but the movie decided instead to focus instead on (who at this juncture was a big name star) while Timothy's character was given short shrift with what was essentially a cameo. Into the millennium Timothy had a slight taste of his former glory while showing a keen talent for parody with his uncanny impersonation of president George W. Bush. Who would have thought? Bottoms' dead-on spoof on , courtesy of the creators of \"South Park\", led to a brief Bush cameo in the family film and the much more serious TV-movie . Interestingly, Timothy needed little in the way of prosthetics. He simply parted his hair differently, added a bit of a drawl and imitated his walk! The still boyish-looking actor with that same trickle of sadness and discomfort has worked continuously for the past thirty years and appeared in over 65 films. Of late he has shined in small independent features such as with his dysfunctional father in writer/director 's , which chronicled a Columbine High School-like massacre, and his closer-to-home portrayal as a middle-aged actor in search of his early fame in . Other millennium films include , , the remake of 's , , and the quirky romantic comedy opposite the producer/writer/director of the film . In addition, he has been frequently viewed in such comedic and dramatic TV movies as , , , and , and made guest appearances on the popular series \"The Governor's Wife,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"Private Practice\" and \"The Bridge.\" Timothy's marriage to folk singer Alicia Cory from 1975 to 1978, produced son Bartholomew. He has three other children (Benton, William, Bridget) with current wife (since 1984) Marcia Morehart. Bottoms divides his time between his acting work and his other great love of training wild horses at his two ranches near Big Sur, California. On the sly he has worked as a surveyor's assistant. While brothers Joseph and Ben are lesser seen these days and finding satisfying lives outside the Hollywood realm, Sam pursued his own career until his death from brain cancer in 2008 at age 53. Their eldest brother continues to display his talents with more recent prime roles in such films as the dramedy , horror opus and the adventure thriller ."

    "description": "He possessed the same special brand of rebel/misfit sensitivity and charm that made superstars out of John Garfield and (later) James Dean and Montgomery Clift. In the war-torn 1940s, Robert Walker represented MGM's fresh, instinctive breed of up-and-coming talent. His boyish good looks combined with an attractive vulnerability came across the screen with such beauty, power and naturalness. He went quite far in his short life; however, the many tortured souls he played so brilliantly closely mirrored the actor himself and the demons that haunted his own being wasted no time in taking him down a self-destructive path for which there was no return. Walker was born Robert Hudson Walker in 1918 in Salt Lake City, Utah, the youngest of four sons of Zella (McQuarrie) and Horace Hudson Walker, a news editor for the local paper. He was of English and Scottish descent. His maternal aunt, Hortense (McQuarrie) Odlum, was the first female president of Bonwit Teller. His parents separated while he was quite young and the anxiety and depression built up over this loss marred his early school years, which were marked by acts of belligerent aggression and temper tantrums, resulting in his being expelled from school several times. To control his behavioral problems, a positive activity was sought that could help him develop confidence and on which he could focus his energies. It came in the form of acting. Following a lead in a school play at the San Diego Army and Navy Academy at Carlsbad-by-the-Sea, California, Walker entered an acting contest at the Pasadena Playhouse and won a top performance prize. A well-to-do aunt paid for his tuition at the American Academy of Dramatic Art (AADA) in 1938, and he was on his way. Things started off quite promisingly. While there he met fellow student Phyllis Isley who went on to play to his in a production of \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" (Phyllis was later renamed ). The couple fell in love and both quit the academy in order to save money and marry, but they found little work other than some small parts at a Greenwich Village theater. They eventually found a radio job together in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and married on January 2, 1939, honeymooning in Hollywood in order to secure more acting parts. Other than some radio jobs and bit parts in films, the move didn't pan out. The couple returned to New York and started a family. Sons (born 1940) and (born 1941) would both become actors in their own right. Following their births Jennifer returned to auditioning and caught the eye of producer , who took an immediate interest in her and signed her to a contract. Selznick was also instrumental in securing a contract for Robert over at MGM. Stardom would be theirs as a result of this Selznick association, but at quite a cost to Robert. Robert gained immediate attention in his first important MGM role as a shy, ill-fated sailor in , but was miscast as a scientist in the biopic . Hollywood notice would come in the form of his sweet, sad-sack title role in the service comedy , the story of a cub reporter who is drafted into the army. The role brought out all the touching, fascinating qualities of Robert. In the meantime, Jennifer became so caught up in her obsessive relationship with mentor Selznick that she broke off with Robert. The actor was devastated and abruptly turned to heavy drinking. He would never completely recover from this loss. The first of many skirmishes with the law came about when he was arrested on a hit-and-run charge. In another self-destructive act, he agreed to appear with his estranged wife in the Selznick film . Although he suffered great anguish during the filming, the movie was praised by critics. He played a young soldier who dies before the end of the last reel, and audiences identified with him in both his troubled on- and off-screen roles. Another vivid part that showed off Walker's star quality came opposite the equally troubled in , a simple romantic story of two lost souls, a soldier and a girl, who accidentally meet while he is on furlough. The tumultuous state of Walker's not-so-private life began to seriously affect his screen career in the late 1940s. In the musical he played composer but was eclipsed by the musical numbers and flurry of special guests. He was third billed behind and , who portrayed pianist and mentally unstable composer , in . Robert played famed composer and friend . Following a lead part as a love-struck window dresser in , which focused more on 's creative vision of loveliness, he impulsively married , the daughter of famed director . The marriage ended in divorce after just five months, following more erratic outbursts, including arrests for drunkenness. By this time Jennifer had married Selznick, and this pushed Robert over the brink. He was committed to a sanatorium and not released until the middle of 1949. After his recovery and release, he was back to work with top roles in the comedy opposite and the western starring . Robert happened to be loaned out to Warner Bros. when he was handed the most memorable film role of his career, that of the charming psychopath who attempts to trade murder favors with in 's classic thriller . Hailed by the critics, Robert was mesmerizing in the part and part of the Hollywood elite once again. He had begun filming Paramount's , which included , and in the cast, when tragedy occurred. Robert had just finished principal photography and was making himself available for re-shoots for director when, on the night of August 28, 1951, his housekeeper found him in an extremely agitated state. Failing to calm him down, she panicked and called his psychiatrist, who, upon arrival, administered a dose of sodium amytal, a sedative, which Walker had taken in the past. Unfortunately, he had been drinking as well and suffered an acute allergic reaction to the drug. Robert stopped breathing, and all efforts to resuscitate him failed. His death cut short the career of a man destined to become one of the most charismatic actors in film. As for life imitating art, perhaps Robert's agonies are what brought out the magnificence of his acting."

    "description": "Curd JÃ¼rgens (commonly billed as \"Curt Jurgens\" in anglophone countries) was one of the most successful European film actors of the 20th Century. He was born Curd Gustav Andreas Gottlieb Franz JÃ¼rgens on December 13, 1915, in Solln, Bavaria, in Hohenzollern Imperial Germany, a subject of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Of Franco-German parentage, JÃ¼rgens -- who was born during the closing days of the second year of the First World War -- would abandon the country of his birth after the end of World War II: JÃ¼rgens became an Austrian citizen in 1945 and lived part-time in France. JÃ¼rgens entered the journalism profession after receiving his education, and married Louise Basler, an actress. Basler, the first of his five wives, encouraged him to switch careers and become an actor. He learned his new profession on the Vienna stage, which retained his loyalty even after he became an global film star. JÃ¼rgens was sent to a concentration camp for \"political unreliables\" in 1944, due to his anti-Nazi opinions. It was this experience in Nazi Germany that led him to become an Austrian citizen after the war. His appearance in (\"The Devil's General\" (1955)), established him as a star of German cinema, and his role as 's older lover in 's (And God Created Woman (1956)) made him an international star. Always interested in multilingual European actors with good looks and talent, Hollywood beckoned the 6' 4\" JÃ¼rgens, casting him in as a WWII German U-boat commander in a duel with American destroyer commander . He constantly was in demand to play Germany military officers (e.g., , the most expensive black-and-white film ever made) -- indeed, his last role was as \"The General\" in the miniseries -- and Germanic villains (e.g., \"Cornelius\", the cowardly and treacherous trading company representative, in ) for the rest of his life. One of his most famous roles in the English-language cinema was as the James Bond villain, \"Karl Stromberg\", in ; it was Moore's favorite Bond film. JÃ¼rgens considered himself primarily a stage actor and often performed on the Vienna stage. Though the world knew him as a cinema actor, he also directed several films and wrote several screenplays and an autobiography, \"Sixty and Not Yet Wise\" (1975). His death from a heart attack in 1982 in Vienna was front-page news across Austria and Germany."

    "description": "Frank Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants Natalina Della (Garaventa), from Northern Italy, and Saverio Antonino Martino Sinatra, a Sicilian boxer, fireman, and bar owner. Growing up on the gritty streets of Hoboken made Sinatra determined to work hard to get ahead. Starting out as a saloon singer in musty little dives (he carried his own P.A. system), he eventually got work as a band singer, first with The Hoboken Four, then with and then . With the help of George Evans (Sinatra's genius press agent), his image was shaped into that of a street thug and punk who was saved by his first wife, . In 1942 he started his solo career, instantly finding fame as the king of the bobbysoxers--the young women and girls who were his fans--and becoming the most popular singer of the era among teenage music fans. About that time his film career was also starting in earnest, and after appearances in a few small films, he struck box-office gold with a lead role in with , a Best Picture nominee at the 1946 Academy Awards. Sinatra was awarded a special Oscar for his part in a short film that spoke out against intolerance, . His career on a high, Sinatra went from strength to strength on record, stage and screen, peaking in 1949, once again with Gene Kelly, in the MGM musical and . A controversial public affair with screen siren broke up his marriage to and did his career little good, and his record sales dwindled. He continued to act, although in lesser films such as , and a vocal cord hemorrhage all but ended his career. He fought back, though, finally securing a role he desperately wanted--Maggio in . He won an Oscar for best supporting actor and followed this with a scintillating performance as a cold-blooded assassin hired to kill the US President in . Arguably a career-best performance--garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor--was his role as a pathetic heroin addict in the powerful drama . Known as \"One-Take Charlie\" for his approach to acting that strove for spontaneity and energy, rather than perfection, Sinatra was an instinctive actor who was best at playing parts that mirrored his own personality. He continued to give strong and memorable performances in such films as , and . In the late 1950s and 1960s Sinatra became somewhat prolific as a producer, turning out such films as , and the very successful . Lighter roles alongside \"Rat Pack\" buddies and were lucrative, especially the famed . On the other hand, he alternated such projects with much more serious offerings, such as , regarded by many critics as Sinatra's finest picture. He made his directorial debut with the World War II picture , which was the first Japanese/American co-production. That same year was a box office sensation. In 1967 Sinatra returned to familiar territory in 's , once again playing as assassin in his only film to be shot in the U.K. and Germany. That same year he starred as a private investigator in , a role he reprised in the sequel, . He also starred with in , a film daring for its time with its theme of murders involving rich and powerful homosexual men, and it was a major box-office success. After appearing in the poorly received comic western , Sinatra didn't act again for seven years, returning with a made-for-TV cops-and-mob-guys thriller , which he also produced. Based on the novel by , this fable of fed-up cops turning vigilante against the mob boasted a stellar cast and was a ratings success. Sinatra returned to the big screen in , once again playing a New York detective, in a moving and understated performance that was a fitting coda to his career as a leading man. He made one more appearance on the big screen with a cameo in and a final acting performance in , in 1987, as a retired police detective seeking vengeance on the killers of his granddaughter, in an episode entitled ."

He was a longtime mainstay in the WWF, and was one of the biggest \"bad guys\" in the WWF during the early '80s, before becoming a fan favorite in the late '80s. He became infamous for his mouth as much as his skills in the ring. He hosted Pipers Pit, which saluted the bad guys of professional wrestling, the most famous of which involved him smashing Jimmy Superfly Snuka over the head with a coconut. He was wrestling's most popular villain because of his feud with Hulk Hogan that culminated at Wrestlemania I. He went into semi-retirement after Wrestlemania III, when he beat and shaved the late Adrian Adonis. He continued to wrestle into the '90s, but spent much of his time doing color commentary for WWF TV. In January 1992, he won the WWF Intercontinental Title from \"The Mountie\", the only title he would ever hold in his storied WWF career. After losing the title three months later, he left the WWF, and only made the occasional appearance in the ring over the next few years. In 1995, he had a stint as the WWF's interim president. He later resurfaced in WCW during the late '90s to continue his feud with \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, until the company's demise in 2001. Roddy Piper appeared in many action films.

    "description": "Jeffrey Hunter was born Henry Herman McKinnies Jr. on November 25, 1926 in New Orleans, Louisiana, an only child. His parents met at the University of Arkansas, and when he was almost four his family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In his teens, he acted in productions of the North Shore Children's Theater and, from 1942 to 1944, performed in summer stock with the local Port Players, along with , and . Hunter was also a radio actor at WTMJ, getting his first professional paycheck in 1945 for the wartime series \"Those Who Serve.\" After graduation from Whitefish Bay High School, where he was co-captain of the football team, he enlisted in the United States Navy and underwent training at Great Lakes Naval Station, Illinois, in 1945-1946, but on the eve of his shipping out for active duty in Japan he took ill and received a medical discharge from the service. Hunter attended and graduated from Northwestern University with a bachelor's degree in 1949, where he acquired more stage experience in Sheridan's \"The Rivals\" and 's \"Years Ago\". He also did summer stock with Northwestern students at Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania in 1948, worked on two Northwestern Radio Playshop broadcasts, was president of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity, and was active in the campus film society with , later acting in director David Bradley's production of in 1949. He then attended graduate school at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he studied radio and drama. He was in the cast of a UCLA production of Arthur Miller's \"All My Sons\" in May, 1950; on opening night, the good-looking Hunter drew the attention of talent scouts from Paramount and 20th Century-Fox Studios. Hunter made a screen test with in a scene from \"All My Sons\" at Paramount (where he met , his future wife), but after an executive shake-up at that studio derailed his hiring, he was signed by 20th Century Fox (where he remained under contract until 1959) and within a month was sent on location in New York for . Hunter was kept fairly busy in pictures, working his way from featured roles to starring roles to first-billing within two years in . His big break came with John Ford's classic, , where he played the young cowboy who accompanies on his epic search for a child kidnapped by Comanches. Hunter got excellent reviews for his performance in this film and justifiably so, as he held his own well with the veteran Wayne. Starring roles in two more John Ford movies followed, and in 1960, Hunter had one of his best roles in , the true story of World War II hero Guy Gabaldon. That same year, Hunter landed the role for which he is probably best known (although it's far from his best work), when he played Jesus in producer Samuel Bronston's , which due to Hunter's still youthful looks at 33, was dubbed by irreverent Hollywood wags \"I Was a Teenage Jesus.\" After the cancellation of his Western series , and his decision not to continue in the lead role of the current series , his career took a downturn, and Hunter eventually wound up in Europe working on cheap Westerns, at the time a sure sign of a career in trouble. While in Spain in November 1968 to film Cry Chicago (Â¡Viva AmÃ©rica!), a story about the Chicago Mafia, Hunter was injured in an on-set explosion when a car window near him, which had been rigged to explode outward, accidentally exploded inward. Hunter sustained a serious concussion. According to Hunter's wife Emily, he \"went into shock\" on the flight back to the United States after filming and \"couldn't speak. He could hardly move.\" After landing, Hunter was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, but doctors could not find any serious injuries except for a displaced vertebra and a concussion. On the afternoon of May 26, 1969, Hunter suffered an intracranial hemorrhage while walking down a three-stair set of steps at his home in Van Nuys, California. He fell, knocked over a planter, and struck his head on the banister, fracturing his skull. He was found unconscious by Frank Bellow, an actor and a friend of Hunter's, who came for a visit, and taken to Valley Presbyterian Hospital, where he underwent brain surgery. He died at about 9:30 the following morning at the age of 42."

He was the son of Ethel \"Sunny\" Anderson (Fogg; 1888-1988) and William Brooks Clift (1886-1964). His father made a lot of money in banking but was quite poor during the depression. His mother was born out of wedlock and spent much of her life and the family fortune finding her illustrious southern lineage and raising her children as aristocrats. At age 13, Monty appeared on Broadway (\"Fly Away Home\"), and chose to remain in the New York theater for over ten years before finally succumbing to Hollywood. He gained excellent theatrical notices and soon piqued the interests of numerous lovelorn actresses; their advances met with awkward conflict. While working in New York in the early 1940s, he met wealthy former Broadway star . She developed an intense decade-plus obsession over the young actor, even financing an experimental play, \"Mexican Mural\" for him. It was ironic his relationship with the bisexual middle-aged Holman would be the principal (and likely the last) heterosexual relationship of his life and only cause him further anguish over his sexuality. She would wield considerable influence over the early part of his film career, advising him in decisions to decline lead roles in , (originally written specifically for him; the story perhaps hitting a little too close to home) and . His long apprenticeship on stage made him a thoroughly accomplished actor, notable for the intensity with which he researched and approached his roles. By the early 1950s he was exclusively homosexual, though he continued to hide his homosexuality and maintained a number of close friendships with theater women (heavily promoted by studio publicists). His film debut was with quickly followed by his early personal success (Oscar nominations for this, , and ). By 1950, he was troubled with allergies and colitis (the U.S. Army had rejected him for military service in World War II for chronic diarrhea) and, along with pill problems, he was alcoholic. He spent a great deal of time and money on psychiatry. In 1956, during filming of , he ran his Chevrolet into a tree after leaving a party at 's; it was she who saved him from choking by pulling out two teeth lodged in his throat. His smashed face was rebuilt, he reconciled with his estranged father, but he continued bedeviled by dependency on drugs and his unrelenting guilt over his homosexuality. With his Hollywood career in an irreversible slide despite giving an occasional riveting performance, such as in 's , Monty returned to New York and tried to slowly develop a somewhat more sensible lifestyle in his brownstone row house on East 61st Street in Manhattan. He was set to play in Taylor's , when he died in the early morning hours of July 23, 1966, at his home at age 45. His body was found by his live-in personal secretary/companion Lorenzo James, who found Clift lying nude on top of his bed, dead from what the autopsy called \"occlusive coronary artery disease.\" Clift's last 10 years prior to his death from his 1956 car accident were called the \"longest suicide in history\" by famed acting teacher ."

His great-grandfather was the first Tyrone Power (1795-1841), a famed Irish comedian. His father, known to historians as Tyrone Power Sr., but to his contemporaries as either Tyrone Power or Tyrone Power the Younger, was a huge star in the theater (and later in films) in both classical and modern roles. His mother, Helen Emma \"Patia\" (nÃ©e Reaume), (), was also a Shakespearean actress as well as a respected dramatic coach. Tyrone Edmund Power, Jr., (also called Tyrone Power III) was born at his mother's home of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, French Huguenot, and French-Canadian. A frail, sickly child, he was taken by his parents to the warmer climate of southern California. After his parents' divorce, he and his sister returned to Cincinnati with their mother. There he attended school while developing an obsession with acting. Although raised by his mother, he corresponded with his father, who encouraged his acting dreams. He was a supernumerary in his father's stage production of 'The Merchant of Venice' in Chicago and held him as he died suddenly of a heart attack later that year. Startlingly handsome, young Tyrone nevertheless struggled to find work in Hollywood. He appeared in a few small roles, then went east to do stage work. A screen test led to a contract at 20th Century Fox in 1936, and he quickly progressed to leading roles. Within a year or so, he was one of Fox's leading stars, playing in contemporary and period pieces with ease. Most of his roles were colorful without being deep, and his swordplay was more praised than his wordplay. He served in the Marine Corps in World War II as a transport pilot, and he saw action in the Pacific Theater of operations. After the war, he got his best reviews for an atypical part as a downward-spiraling con-man in . Although he remained a huge star, much of his postwar work was unremarkable. He continued to do notable stage work and also began producing films. Following a fine performance in 's , Power began production on . Halfway through shooting, he suffered a heart attack during a dueling scene with and died before reaching a hospital. His three children, including his namesake, Tyrone William Power IV (known professionally as ), have all followed him in the family acting tradition."

    "description": "Along with fellow actors Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi and Vincent Price, Boris Karloff is recognized as one of the true icons of horror cinema, and the actor most closely identified with the general public's image of the Frankenstein Monster from the classic 1818 Mary Shelley novel \"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\". William Henry Pratt was born on November 23, 1887, in Camberwell, London, England, UK, the son of Edward John Pratt Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Customs Salt and Opium, Northern Division, Indian Salt Revenue Service, and his third wife, Eliza Sarah Millard. He was educated at London University in anticipation that he would pursue a diplomatic career; however, he emigrated to Canada in 1909, joined a touring company based out of Ontario and adopted the stage name of \"Boris Karloff.\" He toured back and forth across the U.S. for over 10 years in a variety of low budget theater shows and eventually ended up in Hollywood, reportedly with very little money to his name. Needing cash to support himself, Karloff secured occasional acting work in the fledgling silent film industry in such films as , , and , in addition to a handful of film serials (the majority of these, sadly, are all lost films). Karloff supplemented his meager film income by working as a truck driver in Los Angeles, which allowed him enough time off to continue to pursue acting roles. His big break finally came when he was cast as the Frankenstein Monster in the Universal production of , which was directed by , one of the studio's few remaining auteur directors. The aura of mystery surrounding Karloff was highlighted in the opening credits, as he was listed as simply \"?\". The film was a commercial and critical success for Universal, and Karloff was instantly established as a hot property in Hollywood. He quickly appeared in several other sinister roles, including (filmed before ), as the black-humored , as the titular Chinese villain of 's Dr. Fu Manchu novels in , as the living mummy Im-ho-tep in and as the misguided Prof. Morlant in . He thoroughly enjoyed his role as a religious fanatic in 's film , although contemporary critics described it as a textbook example of overacting. He donned the signature make-up, neck bolts and asphalt spreader's boots to play the Frankenstein Monster twice more, the first time in the sensational and the second time in the less thrilling . Karloff, on loan to Fox, appeared in one of the best of the Charlie Chan films, , before beginning his own short-lived detective film series as Mr. Wong. He was a wrongly condemned doctor in , the shaven-headed executioner Mord the Merciless in , another misguided scientist in , a crazed scientist surrounded by monsters, vampires and werewolves in , a murderous cab-man in and a Greek general fighting vampires in the thriller . While Karloff continued to appear in a plethora of films, many of them were not up to the standards of his previous efforts, including his appearances in two of the hokey and monster films (he had appeared with both of them in an earlier, superior film, , of which theater owners often added his name to the marquee) at the low point of the Universal-International horror film cycle. During the 1950s he was a regular guest on many high-profile TV shows, including , , , , and , just to name a few, and he appeared in a mixed bag of films, including and . On Broadway, he appeared as the murderous Jonathan Brewster in the hit play \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" (his role, or rather the absence of him in it, was amusingly parodied in the play's 1944 film version) and 10 years later he enjoyed a long run in another hit play, \"Peter Pan,\" perfectly cast as Captain Hook. His career experienced something of a revival in the 1960s thanks to hosting the TV anthology series and independent film director , with Karloff contributing wonderful performances in , , the ultra-eerie and the -inspired . Karloff's last great film role before his death was as Byron Orlok, an aging and bitter horror film star on the brink of retirement who confronts a modern-day sniper in the -directed film . After this, he played Professor John Marsh in , in which he co-starred with Sir and ; it was the last film that he starred in that was released in his lifetime. Before these two films, he played the blind sculptor Franz Badulescu in which was produced, directed and written by , who had also come to the art of film from the stage and the theater; it was released in the U.S. in 1971 after his death. His TV career was topped off by achieving Christmas immortality as both the voices of the titular character and the narrator of ' perennial animated favorite, . Four low budget horror films that were made in Mexico and starred an ailing Karloff, whose scenes for all four of them were shot on a soundstage in Hollywood, were released theatrically in Mexico in 1968 and then were released directly to television in the U.S. after his death between 1971 and 1972; however, they do no justice to this great actor. In retrospect, he never took himself too seriously as an actor and had a tendency to downplay his acting accomplishments. Renowned as a refined, kind and warm-hearted gentleman with a sincere affection for both children and their welfare, Karloff passed away on February 2, 1969 from pneumonia. Respectful of his Indian roots and in true Hindu fashion, he was cremated at Guildford Crematorium, Godalming, Surrey, England, UK, where he is commemorated by a plaque in Plot 2 of the Garden of Remembrance."

    "description": "Joseph Frank Keaton was born on October 4, 1895 in Piqua, Kansas to Joe Keaton and Myra Keaton, Vaudevillian comedians with a popular, ever-changing variety act, which gave their son an eclectic and interesting upbringing. In the earliest days on stage, they traveled with a medicine show that included illusionist Harry Houdini, a family friend. Keaton himself verified the origin of his nickname \"Buster\", given to him by Houdini when the 3-year-old fell down a flight of stairs and Houdini picked him up, dusted him off, and told the boy's father Joe that the fall was \"a buster.\" Savvy showman Joe Keaton liked the nickname, which has stuck for over one century. At age 4, Keaton had already begun acting with his parents on the stage. Their act soon gained the reputation as one of the roughest in the country for their wild, physical onstage antics. It was normal for Joe to throw Buster around the stage and participate in elaborate, dangerous stunts to the awe of audiences. After several years on the Vaudeville circuit, \"The Three Keatons\" toured until Keaton had to break up the act because of his father's increasing alcohol dependence, making him a show business veteran by age 21. While he was looking for work in New York, he had a chance run-in with wildly-successful film star and director , who invited him to be in his upcoming short . This appearance launched Keaton's film career and spawned a friendship that lasted until Arbuckle's sudden death in 1933. By 1920, after making several successful shorts together, Arbuckle moved on to features, and Keaton inherited his studio, allowing him the opportunity to begin producing his own films. By September 1921, tragedy touched Arbuckle's life by way of a scandal, where he was tried three times for the murder of Virginia Rapp. Although he was not guilty of the charges, and never convicted, he was unable to regain his status, and the viewing public would no longer tolerate his presence in film. Keaton stood by his friend and mentor through out the incident, supporting him financially, finding him directorial work, even risking his own budding reputation offering to testify on Arbuckle's behalf. In 1921, Keaton also married his first wife, under unusual circumstance that have never been fully clarified. Popular conjecture states that he was encouraged by to marry into the powerful Talmadge dynasty, that he himself was already a part of. The union bore Keaton two sons. Keaton's independent shorts soon became too limiting for the growing star, and after a string of popular films like , and , Keaton made the transition into feature films. His first feature, , was produced similarly to his short films, and was the dawning of a new era in comedic cinema, where it became apparent to Keaton that he had to put more focus on the story lines and characterization. At the height of his popularity, he was making two features a year, and followed Ages with , and , the latter two he regarded as his best films. The most renowned of Keaton's comedies is , which used cutting edge special effects that received mixed reviews as critics and audiences alike had never seen anything like it, and did not know what to make of it. Modern day film scholars liken the story and effects to , for its high level concept and ground-breaking execution. Keaton's Civil War epic The General (1926) kept up his momentum when he gave audiences the biggest and most expensive sequence ever seen in film at the time. At its climax, a bridge collapses while a train is passing over it, sending the train into a river. This wowed audiences, but did little for its long-term financial success. Audiences did not respond well to the film, disliking the higher level of drama over comedy, and the main character being a Confederate soldier. After a few more silent features, including and , Keaton was informed that his contract had been sold to MGM, by brother-in-law and producer . Keaton regarded the incident as the worst professional mistake he ever made, as it sent his career, legacy, and personal life into a vicious downward spiral for many years. His first film with MGM was , which is regarded as one of his best silent comedies, but the release signified the loss of control Keaton would incur, never again regaining his film -making independence. He made one more silent film at MGM entitled before the sound era arrived. His first appearance in a film with sound was with the ensemble piece , though despite the popularity of it and his previous MGM silents, MGM never allowed Keaton his own production unit, and increasingly reduced his creative control over his films. By 1932, his marriage to had dissolved when she sued him for divorce, and in an effort to placate her, put up little resistance. This resulted in the loss of the home he had built for his family nicknamed \"The Italian Villa\", the bulk of his assets, and contact with his children. Natalie changed their last names from Keaton to Talmadge, and they were disallowed from speaking about their father or seeing him. About 10 years later, when they became of age, they rekindled the relationship with Keaton. His hardships in his professional and private life that had been slowly taking their toll, begun to culminate by the early 1930s resulting in his own dependence on alcohol, and sometimes violent and erratic behavior. Depressed, penniless, and out of control, he was fired by MGM by 1933, and became a full-fledged alcoholic. After spending time in hospitals to attempt and treat his alcoholism, he met second wife Mae Scrivens, a nurse, and married her hastily in Mexico, only to end in divorce by 1935. After his firing, he made several low-budget shorts for Educational Pictures, and spent the next several years of his life fading out of public favor, and finding work where he could. His career was slightly reinvigorated when he produced the short , which many of his fans admire for giving such a good performance during the most difficult and unmanageable years of his life. In 1940, he met and married his third wife Eleanor Norris, who was deeply devoted to him, and remained his constant companion and partner until Keaton's death. After several more years of hardship working as an uncredited, underpaid gag man for comedians such as the Marx Brothers, he was consulted on how to do a realistic and comedic fall for in which an expensive violin is destroyed. Finding no one who could do this better than him, he was given a minor role in the film. His presence reignited interest in his silent films, which lead to interviews, television appearances, film roles, and world tours that kept him busy for the rest of his life. After several more film, television, and stage appearances through the 1960s, he wrote the autobiography \"My Wonderful World of Slapstick\", having completed nearly 150 films in the span of his ground-breaking career. His last film appearance was which premiered seven months after Keaton's death from the rapid onset of lung cancer. Since his death, Keaton's legacy is being discovered by new generations of viewers every day, many of his films are available on YouTube, DVD and Blu-ray, where he, like all gold-gilded and beloved entertainers can live forever."

Originally, the young Fernando intended to become an architect.

    "description": "Richard Widmark established himself as an icon of American cinema with his debut in the 1947 film noir Kiss of Death (1947), in which he won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination as the killer Tommy Udo. Kiss of Death (1947) and other noir thrillers established Widmark as part of a new generation of American movie actors who became stars in the post-World War II era. With fellow post-War stars and , Widmark brought a new kind of character to the screen in his character leads and supporting parts: a hard-boiled type who does not actively court the sympathy of the audience. Widmark was not afraid to play deeply troubled, deeply conflicted, or just downright deeply corrupt characters. After his debut, Widmark would work steadily until he retired at the age of 76 in 1990, primarily as a character lead. His stardom would peak around the time he played the U.S. prosecutor in as the 1950s segued into the 1960s, but he would continue to act for another 30 years. Richard Weedt Widmark was born in Sunrise Township, Minnesota, to Ethel Mae (Barr) and Carl Henry Widmark. His father was of Swedish descent and his mother of English and Scottish ancestry. He has said that he loved the movies from his boyhood, claiming, \"I've been a movie bug since I was 4. My grandmother used to take me\". The teenaged Widmark continued to go to the movies and was thrilled by and . \"I thought was great\", Widmark said. Although he loved the movies and excelled at public speaking while attending high school, Widmark attended Lake Forest College with the idea of becoming a lawyer. However, he won the lead role in a college production of, fittingly enough, the play \"Counsellor-at-Law\", and the acting bug bit deep. After taking his bachelor of arts degree in 1936, he stayed on at Lake Forest as the Assistant Director of Speech and Drama. However, he soon quit the job and moved to New York to become an actor, and by 1938 he was appearing on radio in \"Aunt Jenny's Real Life Stories\". He made his Broadway debut in 1943 in the play \"Kiss and Tell\" and continued to appear on stage in roles that were light-years away from the tough cookies he would play in his early movies. After World War II, he was signed by 20th Century-Fox to a seven-year contract. After seeing his screen test for the role of Tommy Udo, 20th Century-Fox boss insisted that the slight, blonde Widmark - no one's idea of a heavy, particularly after his stage work - be cast as the psychopath in , which had been prepared as a vehicle. Even though the role was small, Widmark stole the picture. The publicity department at 20th Century-Fox recommended that exhibitors market the film by concentrating on thumping the tub for their new antihero. \"Sell Richard Widmark\" advised the studio's publicity manual that an alert 20th Century-Fox sent to theater owners. The manual told local exhibitors to engage a job printer to have \"wanted\" posters featuring Widmark's face printed and pasted up. He won a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod for the part, which led to an early bout with typecasting at the studio. Widmark played psychotics in and and held his own against new Fox superstar in the western , playing the villain, of course. When his pressuring the studio to let him play other parts paid off, his appearance as a sailor in made headlines: Life magazine's March 28, 1949, issue featured a three-page spread of the movie headlined \"Widmark the Movie Villain Goes Straight\". He was popular, having captured the public imagination, and before the decade was out, his hand- and footprints were immortalized in concrete in the court outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. The great director cast Widmark in his thriller , not as the heavy (that role went to ) but as the physician who tracks down Palance, who has the plague, in tandem with detective . Widmark was establishing himself as a real presence in the genre that later would be hailed as film noir. Having proved he could handle other roles, Widmark didn't shy away from playing heavies in quality pictures. The soon-to-be-blacklisted director cast him in one of his greatest roles, as the penny-ante hustler Harry Fabian in . Set in London, Widmark's Fabian manages to survive in the jungle of the English demimonde, but is doomed. Widmark was masterful in conveying the desperation of the criminal seeking to control his own fate but who is damned, and this performance also became an icon of film noir. In that same year, he appeared in Oscar-winning writer-director 's as a bigot who instigates a race riot. As the 1950s progressed, Widmark played in westerns, military vehicles, and his old stand-by genre, the thriller. He appeared with (this time cast as the psycho) in and made that same year for director . His seven-year contract at Fox was expiring, and Zanuck, who would not renew the deal, cast him in the western in a decidedly supporting role, billed beneath not only but even and . The film was well respected, and it won an Oscar nomination for best screenplay for the front of Hollywood 10 blacklistee . Widmark left Fox for the life of a freelance, forming his own company, Heath Productions. He appeared in more westerns, adventures and social dramas and pushed himself as an actor by taking the thankless role of the Dauphin in 's adaptation of 's , a notorious flop that didn't bring anyone any honors, neither Preminger, his leading lady , nor Widmark. In 1960, he was appearing in another notorious production, 's ode to suicidal patriotism, , with the personally liberal Widmark playing Jim Bowie in support of the very conservative Wayne's Davy Crockett. Along with character actor , Widmark arguably was the best thing in the movie. In 1961, Widmark acquitted himself quite well as the prosecutor in producer-director 's , appearing with the Oscar-nominated and the Oscar-winning , as well as with superstar and acting genius and the legendary Judy Garland (the latter two winning Oscar nods for their small roles). Despite being showcased with all this thespian firepower, Widmark's character proved to be the axis on which the drama turned. A little later, Widmark appeared in two westerns directed by the great , with co-star in and as the top star in Ford's apologia for Indian genocide, . On , Ford feuded with Jimmy Stewart over his hat. Stewart insisted on wearing the same hat he had for a decade of highly successful westerns that had made him one of the top box office stars of the 1950s. Both he and Widmark were hard-of-hearing (as well as balding and in need of help from the makeup department's wigmakers), so Ford would sit far away from them while directing scenes and then give them directions in a barely audible voice. When neither one of the stars could hear their director, Ford theatrically announced to his crew that after over 40 years in the business, he was reduced to directing two deaf toupees. It was testimony to the stature of both Stewart and Widmark as stars that this was as far as Ford's baiting went, as the great director could be extraordinarily cruel. Widmark continued to co-star in A-pictures through the 1960s. He capped off the decade with one of his finest performances, as the amoral police detective in 's gritty cop melodrama . With Madigan, one can see Widmark's characters as a progression in the evolution of what would become the late 1960s nihilistic antihero, such as those embodied by in Siegel's later . In the 1970s, he continued to make his mark in movies and, beginning in 1971, in television. In movies, he appeared primarily in supporting roles, albeit in highly billed fashion, in such films as 's , 's , and 's . He even came back as a heavy, playing the villainous doctor in . In 1971, in search of better roles, he turned to television, starring as the President of the U.S. in the TV miniseries . His performance in the role brought Widmark an Emmy nomination. He resurrected the character of Madigan for NBC in six 90-minute episodes that appeared as part of the rotation of \"NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie\" for the fall 1972 season. Widmark was married for 55 years to playwright , from 1942 until her death in 1997 (they had one child, Anne, who was born in 1945). He lived quietly and avoided the press, saying in 1971, \"I think a performer should do his work and then shut up\". Los Angeles Times critic Kevin Thomas thought that Widmark should have won an Oscar nomination for his turn in playing a former rodeo star tutoring Frederic Forrest's character. It is surprising to think that represented his sole Oscar nomination, but with the rise of respect for film noir around the time his career began tapering off in the '70s, he began to be reevaluated as an actor. Unlike Bogart, who did not live to see his reputation flourish after his death, Widmark became a cult figure well before he retired."

One of thirteen children, including fellow actor Steve Forrest, he was a son of Annis (Speed) and Charles Forrest Andrews, a Baptist minister. Andrews studied business administration at Sam Houston State Teachers College in Texas, but took a bookkeeping job with Gulf Oil in 1929, aged 20, prior to graduating. In 1931, he hitchhiked to California, hoping to get work as an actor. He drove a school bus, dug ditches, picked oranges, worked as a stock boy, and pumped gas while trying without luck to break into the movies. His employer at a Van Nuys gas station believed in him and agreed to invest in him, asking to be repaid if and when Andrews made it as an actor. Andrews studied opera and also entered the Pasadena Community Playhouse, the famed theatre company and drama school. He appeared in scores of plays there in the 1930s, becoming a favorite of the company. He played opposite future star in a play about composers Gilbert and Sullivan, and soon thereafter was offered a contract by . It was two years before Goldwyn and 20th Century-Fox (to whom Goldwyn had sold half of Andrews' contract) put him in a film, but the roles, though secondary, were mostly in top-quality pictures such as and . A starring role in the hit , followed by one in , made him a star, but no later film quite lived up to the quality of these. During his career, he had worked with with such directors as , , , , , and . Andrews slipped into a steady stream of unremarkable films in which he gave sturdy performances, until age and other interests resulted in fewer appearances. In addition, his increasing alcoholism caused him to lose the confidence of some producers. Andrews took steps to curb his addiction and in his later years was an outspoken member of the National Council on Alcoholism, who decried public refusal to face the problem. He was probably the first actor to do a public service announcement about alcoholism (in 1972 for the U.S. Department of Transportation), and did public speaking tours. Andrews was one of the first to speak out against the degradation of the acting profession, particularly actresses doing nude scenes just to get a role. Andrews was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1963, serving until 1965. He retired from films in the 1960s and made, he said, more money from real estate than he ever did in movies. Yet he and his second wife, actress Mary Todd, lived quietly in a modest home in Studio City, California. Andrews suffered from Alzheimer's disease in his later years and spent his final days in a nursing facility. He died of congestive heart failure and pneumonia in 1992, aged 83."

    "description": "A tall (6'2\"), sly, cueball-domed comedian of film and television satire, Damon Wayans hit outrageous 90's TV stardom playing various wise guys and streetwise slick characters on older brother Keenen Ivory Wayans' landmark, black-oriented TV sketch comedy In Living Color (1990). The show was pretty much a family act and it made Damon a breakout comedy star. This, in turn, would lead to many of his own popular film comedy vehicles. Born on September 4, 1960, in New York City, Wayans was the third of ten children of Elvira Alethia (Green), a social worker and singer, and Howell Wayans, a supermarket manager. The children grew up humbly in the Fulton Housing Projects and Damon began zeroing in on his innate comedic skills while still a child by conjuring up weird characters. Ostracized by other children due to a severe physical disability (club foot), humor played a strong part in helping Damon handle a severely painful and debilitating childhood. He wore leg braces, orthopedic shoes and endured numerous surgeries before the affliction could be corrected. Dropping out of high school in the ninth grade, he worked various jobs (mail clerk, etc.) until following older brother Keenen out to Hollywood to seek comedy fame and fortune. Doing the typical L.A. stand-up scene starting in 1982, he toured on the national comedy club circuits until earning a regular featured slot on for one season (1985-1986). On the big screen, he nabbed a few bit parts in films that showcased Hollywood's top comedians, including in , his movie debut, and in . He also appeared briefly in brother Keenen's film spoofs and . Damon gained major notice as an alien alongside and future co-star in the wild and woolly film , as well as in various supporting roles that included with and the grim police drama with . Stardom came with TV, however, and his participation in brother Keenan's fast-paced groundbreaking show that truly pushed the limits. It gave Damon a brilliant showcase as both actor and special material writer and he broke out early among the talented ensemble players with his eclectic gallery of characters that often bordered on raunch: Homey the Clown, the disabled Handiman and the outrageously gay film critic Blaine Edwards from the \"Men on Film\" skits. The talented ensemble would include siblings , and . Creative control and financial issues, especially content censoring, led to Keenan abruptly leaving the show in 1992, followed by Damon and his kin within a year. From there Damon pursued film and TV solo stardom. For the next decade and a half, Damon became his own \"Man on Film.\" He was ' partner in the noticeably violent crime thriller ; wrote, executive-produced and starred as a former conman trying to mend his ways in , which also featured younger brother ; expanded his \"In Living Color\" handicapped superhero character Handiman into feature-length form with ; played an in-your-face drill sergeant in the aptly titled ; co-starred with as a policeman bringing in a petty crook (Adam Sandler) in the action comedy ; joined in the basketball-themed ; and stretched his acting muscles in 's comedy-drama . He was also executive producer on , a Saturday morning animated show based on his childhood that featured the voices of younger siblings , and . Although his strongest suit is still in stand-up (he has starred in several HBO comedy specials), Damon went back to steady television employment as star and executive producer of the sitcom . Following the demise of that series, he also wrote, produced, directed and starred in the dramatic film in which he played a green Cleveland stand-up comic hoping to make it big in Los Angeles. He also attempted to follow brother Keenan by creating, writing and appearing in a TV sketch comedy show entitled , which involved second-generation Wayans family. It failed to catch on, however, and was cancelled after 11 episodes. In recent years he has refocused on TV guest work, returning to the series format, however, with a starring role as Detective Roger Murtaugh on the offbeat comedy-drama , based on the film series of the same name. Divorced from his wife Lisa (1984-2000), he is the father of four, including actor ."

    "description": "Known for his trademark gelled spiked up crew cut with sunglasses, Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) is an Indian Bollywood movie star, movie producer, magazine model, showman, public speaker, author, philanthropist and television host/personality working predominantly in Hindi cinema. Khan began his on-camera acting debut in 1987 at the age of 21 by guest starring in various Indian serial drama soap opera TV shows as well as appearing in numerous television commercials and brand advertisements for products. He studied theatre arts and drama during his second year of college after participating in numerous school plays. He landed a few acting gigs in Delhi, before acting on Indian TV and became popular. Khan came down to Mumbai to shoot a TV series with self doubt and under confidence. So he came for a year to give it a shot. He began auditioning for starring roles in Hindi movies in 1990 after the death of his mother (his father died a decade earlier in 1980). Khan's parents died early, which made him heartbroken in Delhi. Khan decided to pursue a full-time acting career and relocating to Mumbai to start afresh, hoping to enjoy acting and overcome the dejecting death of his parents, as there was nothing for him to go back to. He began auditioning for starring roles in Hindi movies in 1990 after the death of his mother (his father died a decade earlier in 1980). After recuperating from a career-ending sports injury, he landed his breakout breakthrough feature film starring role in the Silver screen in June 1992, and rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1990s. Khan shot to stardom in his first feature film \"Deewana\" (1992) which won him the first of 13 Filmfare awards -- the Bollywood equivalent of an Oscar. He continued starring in blockbuster movies throughout the 2000s with a mixed bag of career fluctuations, establishing himself as a very bankable, versatile movie star in the early-to-mid 2010s. Following a 4-year sabbatical hiatus in the wake of the corona-virus pandemic, Khan made a resurgence comeback in 2023, and continues to act and star in A-Lister blockbuster movies. Referred to in the media as the \"Baadshah of Bollywood\" and \"King Khan\", he has appeared in over 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world. Many of his films depict and portray Indian national identity, Indian patriotism, and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances. Shah Rukh Khan has been TAG Heuer's brand ambassador in India since September 2003 & is close friends with Amir. He is Bollywood's most bankable movie stars with brand endorsements & resides in the affluent suburbs of Bandra, Mumbai, India with his wife and children."

    "description": "Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud is not everybody's cup of tea for sure, but will remain an important name in film history. As an actor he can be adored or hated for exactly the same reasons: he is one of those rare players that directors let improvise his dialogue, which gets on certain viewers' nerves while it fascinates others. The same is true for his very personal staccato diction and elocution and his many mannerisms, the most obvious one being his way to run his hand through his long hair. But there is no denying LÃ©aud is not just another actor, whether you love him or are allergic to him. The son of actress Jacqueline Pierreux and scriptwriter/assistant director Pierre LÃ©aud, Jean-Pierre started acting very early. Indeed, he was only thirteen when he first appeared on a screen, playing a small role in a swashbuckling film directed by veteran Georges Lampin \"la Tour, prends garde!\" (1957). And he was still only fourteen when he answered an ad placed in a newspaper by FranÃ§ois Truffaut, who was seeking a young actor able to play Antoine Doinel, a troubled adolescent, in his first feature film \"The 400 blows\". Jean-Pierre was tested among a hundred other candidates and proved so amazingly spontaneous and so gifted for improvisation that not only was he hired but he would go on to play the role in four subsequent Truffaut semi-autobiographies concluding with \"Love on the run\" (1978), a unique experience indeed. Thanks to Truffaut he was introduced to the other stars of the French New Wave, mainly Jean-Luc Godard for whom he would appear in eight films and one TV film, and gradually became their icon. Not too sure about his acting talents, he planned to become a director (which he actually did only once) and worked as an assistant to Truffaut and Godard. But his success both as Truffaut's alter ego and as the leftist movie makers' spokesman encouraged him to go on playing rather than directing. \"Masculin FÃ©minin\" (1966) by Godard even earned him an Award for Best Actor at the Berlin Film Festival. An ardent leftist militant himself, he worked with equally committed directors, including abroad. He was in Italian Pasolini's \"Porcile\" (1968), in Polish Skolimovski's \"Dialog 20-40-60\" (also '68) Brazilian Carlos Diegues' Os herdeiros (1970) and Glauber Rocha's Der Leone have sept cabeÃ§as (1971). Bertolucci also hired him for \"Last tango in Paris\" starring Marlon Brando (who so petrified LÃ©aud that he could not play his scenes alongside him), but this one was filmed in Paris. This busy period ended after an excellent role in a classic art movie in the French style: Jean Eustache's \"La maman et la putain\". In the late seventies and throughout the eighties LÃ©aud worked irregularly, mainly on television, occasionally giving a crazy performance in a mainstream film, as was the case in Josiane's Balasko crime comedy \"Les keufs\", for which he got a CÃ©sar nomination. But he made an exciting comeback in the nineties when several \"new New Wave\" directors hired LÃ©aud to pay homage to their elders. Among them French movie makers such as Olivier Assayas, DaniÃ¨le Dubroux , Serge Le PÃ©ron or Bertrand Bonello and foreigners like Finnish Aki KÃ¤urismÃ¤ki and Taiwanese Tsai Ming-Liang. A second youth for eternally young, rebellious, ill-at-ease, annoyingly romantic,touchingly annoying Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud, whose round face staring at the camera in the last shot of \"The 400 blows\" will never be forgotten."

Although film was a challenge in which he excitedly and hopefully participated, he had small roles in films that are scarcely available, and his real career was in German theatre. He played hundreds of roles in his lifetime. He was married to Fanny Normann, a fellow performer whom he met a short time after his actor's education and shared many times with on stage.

    "description": "Donatas Banionis was a popular Lithuanian actor known for Nobody Wanted to Die (1965), Myortvyy sezon (1968), and Solaris (1972). He was born Donatas Juozas Banionis on April 28, 1924, in Kaunas, Lithuania. His mother, Blazhaitite-Banionene Ona, was a homemaker. His father, Juozas Banionis, was a tailor who took part in the Russian Revolution of 1917, was wounded in the Russian Civil War, then became a political prisoner, and briefly emigrated to Brasil during the 1920s. Young Banionis was raised with his elder sister during the years of Lithuanian independence before WWII. In 1941 Donatas Banionis was hired by the famous Lithuanian theatrical director and became an actor at the newly formed Panevezys Drama Theatre. He studied acting under Juozas Miltinis and graduated from the Panevezys Acting Studio in 1945. In 1947 Banionis made his film debut: he appeared in a cameo role in 'Marite' (1947). His first major film work was the role of adventurer Daus in 'Adomas nori buti zmogumi' (Adam Wants to Be a Man 1959) by director . Long before becoming an acclaimed actor Banionis tried to escape from the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War; but he failed to join his Lithuanian compatriots when they fled the Soviets. Soon the Iron curtain became impenetrable from either side. However, in 1970, as a member of an official Soviet delegation, he made his first visit to the Lithuanian community in Chicago. Then Banionis, being already a famous actor, came to realize that his former compatriots earned their good living and nice homes by working very hard from very poor beginnings. At that time, Banionis enjoyed a highly privileged life as a top film-star in the Soviet Union. He was awarded the State Prize in 1975, and was received by such Soviet leaders as and . Banionis earned critical acclaim for his role of Vaitkus in 'Niekas nenorejo mirti' (Nobody Wanted to Die, 1966) by director Vytautas Zalakevicius. A powerful film, it was even dubbed the \"Lithuanian Seven Samurai.\" Banionis' tragical character Vaitkus is the undecided one among the Lithuanian \"brothers in the woods\", who are fighting against the Soviets after the end of the Second World War. Banionis demonstrated his range as a comedian in the comic role of a priest in 'Beregis avtomobilya' (Watch Out for the Automobile, 1966) by director . Banionis' sweet character blends well with the stellar ensemble of actors, such as , , , , , , and other Russian film stars. Donatas Banionis is a refined intellectual actor with effortless style. His mastery of timing, his powerful silence, and his reserved energy shines in his major film-works; such as in 'King Lear' (1969) by , in 'Solaris' (1972) by Andrei Tarkovsky, in 'Goya - oder Der arge Weg der Erkenntnis' (1971) by director Konrad Wolf, in 'Begstvo mistera Mak-Kinli' by director , in 'Beethoven - Days in a Life' (1976) by director Horst Seemann, and in other films. One of his memorable film-works is the character of a Russian spy 'Ladeinikov' in 'Myortvy Sezon' (The Dead Season, 1968) by director . That film role provided Banionis with an auspicious connection. In 2004, the actor had a meeting with the Russian President . Mr. Putin confirmed that he made up his mind to become an intelligence officer after seeing Banionis in the role of a Russian spy. In his later works Donatas Banionis constitutes the link between cinema of the past and contemporary Lithuanian film. He showed reserved and convincing work in the role of 'The old man' in 'Kiemas' (Courtyard, 1999), a reflective film about a Lithuanian father and his family's depressing fate in the 1970's Soviet Union. He worked with director in 'Attack on Leningrad' (2006), a film about the historic siege during the Second World War; where his acting partners are Gabriel Byrne, Mira Sorvino, , , and others. During his acting career spanning over sixty five years, Donatas Banionis played over 50 roles in film and on television. He also played over 100 stage roles, mainly at the Panevezys Juozas Miltinis' Drama Theatre. Banionis was designated People's Actor of the USSR (1974), and People's actor of the Lithuanian Republic (1973). He is Chevalier of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas.
