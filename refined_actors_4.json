    "description": "George Segal was born on February 13, 1934 in New York City, New York, to Fannie Blanche (Bodkin) and George Segal Sr., a malt and hop agent. All of his grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. After a stint in the military, he made his bones as a stage actor before being cast in his first meaty film role in The Young Doctors (1961). His turns in Ship of Fools (1965) and the eponymous heralded the arrival of a major talent. He followed this up with his Oscar-nominated performance in , in which he more than held his own against and . was a cultural phenomenon, the film that wrecked the MPDDA censorship code that had been in place since 1934, and a huge box office success to boot. By the early 1970s, appearances in such films as , , and had made him a major star with an enviable reputation, just under the heights of the superstar status enjoyed by the likes of . He followed up (a hit film for which his co-star won an Oscar) with his brilliant performance as the out-of-control gambler in 's . At one time in the early 1970s, it seemed like George Segal would have a career like that enjoyed by his contemporary , that of an actor's actor equally adept at comedy and drama. Segal never made the leap to superstar status, and surprisingly, has never won a major acting award, the latter phenomenon being particularly surprising when viewed from the period 1973-74, when he reached the height of his career. It was at this point that Segal's career went awry, when he priced himself as a superstar with a seven-figure salary, but failed to come through at the box office. For example, was a failure, although his subsequent starring turn opposite in was a big hit that revitalized her career. The thriller became a modest hit even during a summer which saw it competing with , and he gave a adroit comic performance in with and , which proved another box office success. For all practical purposes, even after the failures of , and , it seemed like Segal, with a few deft career choices, could reorient his career and deliver on the promise of his early period. At the end of the decade, he dropped out of a movie that would have burnished his tarnished lustre as a star: ' . made a star, while made him a superstar in the 1980s, a lost decade for Segal. It was an example of a career burnout usually associated with the \"Oscar curse\" (his co-star , for example, was a great character actor whose career was run off the rails by the expectations raised by the Academy Award). George Segal has never won an Oscar, but more surprisingly, has only been nominated once, for Best Supporting Actor of 1966 for his role as Nick in . That he didn't return to the promise of the early 1970s may be the unintended consequence of his focusing on comedy to the detriment of drama. The comedy made him a million dollar-per-film movie star, and that's what he concentrated on. Segal began relying on his considerable charm to pull off movies that had little going for them other than their star, and it backfired on him. These films weren't infused with the outrageously funny, subversive comedy of , a success from his first period that he enjoyed along with co-star and director . When Segal first made it in the mid-1960s, he established his serious actor bona fides with a deal he cut with ABC-TV that featured him in TV adaptations of Broadway plays. He also played a very memorable Biff Loman in , shining in performance in counterpoint to the vital presence that was 's Willy Loman. It was a good life for an actor, and he took time to show off his banjo-playing skills by fronting the Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band, with which he cut several records. While the 1980s were mostly a career wasteland for Segal, with no starring roles in hit films, he remained a popular figure on television, and appeared regularly on , where he would routinely sing and play the banjo during interviews. After a major role in the surprise hit , he co-starred with and in , leading to a career revival in the 1990s, using his flair for comedy as part of the ensemble cast of . In the 2010s, he co-starred as the eccentric but lovable grandfather on the hit sitcom . On February 14, 2017, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television on his 83rd birthday. George Segal died at age 87 of complication from bypass surgery on March 23, 2021 in Santa Rosa, California."

There can be no doubt that the remarkably talented Leguizamo has been a breakthrough performer for the Latino community in mainstream Hollywood, in much the same way that crashed through celluloid barriers for African-Americans in the early 1960s. Among his many strengths lies his ability to not take his ethnic background too seriously but also to take pride in his Latino heritage. He has opened many doors for his countrymen. A masterly and accomplished performer, movie audiences await Leguizamo's next exciting performance."

    "description": "Om Puri was an Indian actor who has appeared in both mainstream Indian films and art films. His credits also include appearances in British and American films. He has received an honorary OBE. Puri was born in Ambala, Haryana. His father worked on the railways and served in the Indian Army. Puri graduated from the Film and Television Institute of India. He is also an alumnus of the 1973 class of National School of Drama where Naseeruddin Shah was a co-student. Puri had worked in numerous Indian films and in many films produced in the United Kingdom and the United States. He made his film debut in the 1976 film Ghashiram Kotwal, based on a Marathi play of the same name. He has claimed that he was paid \"peanuts\" for his best work. He had collaborated with Amrish Puri as well as Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil in art films such as Bhavni Bhavai (1980), Sadgati (1981), Ardh Satya (1982), Mirch Masala (1986) and Dharavi (1992). He had been active in cinema. He was critically acclaimed for his performances in many unconventional roles such as a victimized tribal in Aakrosh (1980) (a film in which he spoke only during flash-back sequences); Jimmy's manager in Disco Dancer (1982); a police inspector in Ardh Satya (1982), where he revolts against life-long social, cultural and political persecution and for which he got the National Film Award for Best Actor; the leader of a cell of Sikh militants in Maachis (1996); as a tough cop again in the commercial film Gupt in 1997; and as the courageous father of a martyred soldier in Dhoop (2003). In 1999, Puri acted in a Kannada movie A.K. 47 as a strict police officer who tries to keep the city safe from the underworld - it became a huge commercial hit. Puri's acting in the movie is very memorable. He has rendered his own voice for the Kannada dialogues. In the same year, he starred in the successful British comedy film East is East, where he played a first-generation Pakistani immigrant in the north of England, struggling to come to terms with his far more westernized children. Om Puri had a cameo in the highly acclaimed film Gandhi (1982, directed by Richard Attenborough). In the mid-1990s, he diversified to play character roles in mainstream Hindi cinema, where his roles are more tuned to mass audiences than film critics. He became known internationally by starring in many British films such as My Son the Fanatic (1997), East Is East (1999) and The Parole Officer (2001). He appeared in Hollywood films including City of Joy (1992), opposite Patrick Swayze; Wolf (1994) alongside Jack Nicholson; and The Ghost and the Darkness (1996) opposite Val Kilmer. In 2007, he appeared as General Zia-ul-Haq in Charlie Wilson's War, which stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. He has worked in Hindi television serials like Kakkaji Kaheen (1988) (roughly meaning \"Uncle says\") as a paan-chewing 'Kakkaji', which was a parody on politicians, and Mr. Yogi (1989) as a suave 'Sutradhaar' who enjoys pulling the protagonist's leg. These two serials underlined Om Puri's versatility as a comedian. He received critical acclaim for him performance in Govind Nihalani's television film Tamas (1987) based on a Hindi novel of the same name. He essayed comic roles in Hindi films like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro which reached a cult status, followed by Chachi 420 (1997), Hera Pheri (2000), Chor Machaye Shor (2002) and Malamaal Weekly (2006). His more recent Hindi film roles include Singh Is Kinng, Mere Baap Pehle Aap and Billu. Puri was seen in the role of Mohammad Ali Kasuri in Road to Sangam (2009). In 2010, he appeared in The Hangman. In 2011 he was in the Indian action movie Don 2. He had also worked in Aahat TV Series in some episodes during second season which was aired between 2004-2005 on Sony channel."

    "description": "Stylish Rupert James Hector Everett was born on May 29, 1959, in Burnham Deepdale, Norfolk, to Sara (Maclean) and Anthony Michael Everett, a Major in the British Army, who later worked in business. Of royal stock, he is of primarily English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry with a dash of German and Dutch thrown in for good measure. Everett grew up in privileged circumstances, but the wry, sometimes arrogant intellectual was a rebel from the very beginning. At the age of seven, he was placed into the care of Benedictine monks at Ampleforth College where he trained classically on the piano. He was expelled from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London for clashing with his teachers and instead apprenticed himself at the avant-garde Glasgow Citizen's Theatre in Scotland, performing in such productions as \"Don Juan\" and \"Heartbreak House.\" He moved from stage to British TV in 1982 with sophisticated appearances on such series as \"Strangers\" \"Play for Today\" and \"The Agatha Christie Hour\" and the more visibly seen mini-series and . In 1984, Everett filmed a leading gay role in the acclaimed collegiate-themed picture , which he had performed earlier on stage in 1981. Earning a BAFTA nomination and shooting to international attention, Rupert became one of England's hottest crossover stars. Top patrician roles in quality films came his way such as opposite and starring and . The rebel went international instead of Hollywood, however, with top-billing in the Aussie feature with ; the Italian-made and the French drama opposite . Again, however, the wickedly sharp and suave actor doused his own star fire by clashing with the press and even his own fans in the late 1980's. In 1989, Everett openly and proudly declared his homosexuality which put an initial damper on his status as a romantic leading man. Appearing sporadically in such featured roles as the Prince of Wales in the majestic drama and Lord Rutledge in the family comedy , Rupert's popularity was re-energized after playing ' gay confidante to droll effect in the box-office comedy hit , earning him both BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations. He continued to impress thereafter, notably in such classical-styled pieces as (as Christopher Marlowe), (as Oberon), and the plays (as Lord Goring, Golden Globe nominee) and (as Algy). On the lighter, fun side, his predilection for mischief was demonstrated as the cartoonish villain Dr. Claw, the nemesis of 's title character, in . Into the millennium, Rupert continued to be a vibrant presence on stage with a tour of \"Private Lives\" (in Italian) in 2008, a 2009 Broadway revival of \"Blithe Spirit\" (his New York debut) and as Henry Higgins in Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" in Munich the following year. He went on to play Oscar Wilde in \"The Judas Kiss\" in 2013 and was about to play George on Broadway in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" when the play closed before it officially opened due to the COVID pandemic in 2020. On TV, he played the effortlessly suave Sherlock Holmes in , the Marquis de Feron in the British series and Carroll Quinn in a second British series . On film, Everett enhanced the royal dramas and as King Charles I and King Charles II, respectively. Known for his aloof handsomeness and often smug, piss-elegant characters, he engagingly portrayed a jet-setter in the contemporary film ; provided the voice of the unprincely Prince Charming in the animated features and ; played a British defector opposite in the romantic thriller ; a millionaire playboy involved in a hit-and-run in ; an eccentric tycoon in ; King George VI (father of Queen Elizabeth) opposite 's Queen Mum in the romantic dramedy ; a monsignor in ; and tortured gay playwright during his last days in , which he wrote and directed.

Rather than go straight to acting school he read theology at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge and then travelled to Nepal, where he became interested in Buddhism. On return he enrolled at RADA in London, graduating in 2010 and, just before graduating bagging a (very) small part as Carey Mulligan's boyfriend in the final scene of 'An Education'. In 2011 he appeared on the London stage in revivals of 'Journey's End' and 'The Lion in Winter' with Joanna Lumley and Robert Lindsay. At the tail end of 2013 he was in the faux-Austen mystery 'Death Comes To Pemberley' on television but 2014 has been the year when he became known to a wider audience via the period films 'Mr Turner' and 'Belle' as the heroine's first love interest and most particularly violent serial 'Happy Valley' as a murderous kidnapper and rapist and, by contrast in the post-war set whodunit series 'Grantchester' as a tipsy young vicar with a penchant for solving cases."

    "description": "Remote, somewhat morose and, as a result, intriguing, Viennese talent Oskar Werner was born in 1922, not far from the birthplace of \"Waltz King\" Johann Strauss, and christened Oskar Josef Bschließmayer. His parents divorced when he was fairly young. While growing up, Oskar found performing in school plays helped draw out a deep yearning to act. As a teenager, Oskar was further tempted when his uncle managed to find him some un-credited roles in a couple of German and Austrian war-era films. Oskar dropped out of high school in order to pursue acting. Not long after, he became the youngest actor ever, up until that point, to be offered membership to the Burgtheater. His name was changed to 'Oskar Werner', and he made his official debut in 1941. His career, however, was almost immediately interrupted by World War II. An avowed pacifist and fervent loathing of the Nazi regime, Werner eventually was forced to wear the German Axis army uniform, but finagled his way into KP duty feigning incompetence. Moreover, he married Elizabeth Kallina, a half-Jewish actress, which further endangered his life. Their daughter, Elinore, was born in 1944. The young family spent much of their time in the Vienna woods, hiding from both the Russians and Germans after the city was shelled. In post-war years, Oskar returned to the Burgtheater and widened his range of classics on the stage. Performing in such productions as \"The Misanthrope\", \"I Remember Mama\", \"Julius Caesar\" and \"Danton's Death\", he also played a diverse range of character roles and \"older men\" parts. He did not make any kind of dent in films until appearing in both the German (1948) and English versions of as one of the more dissolute members of a family of piano makers. An aloof, handsome blond with wide-set, hooded eyes and quietly solemn features, Werner showed extreme promise in just a few Austrian/German films, including the role of composer Beethoven's manipulative young nephew 'Karl' in the Austrian-made . Less than 2 years later, Oskar would have a resounding hit starring in his very first English-language film, , as the German prisoner of war protagonist in the Fox feature. Though ready for film-stardom, Werner's experience with the film studios quickly soured him on Hollywood, as it failed on its promise to develop him into a Hollywood commodity. As a result, he returned to Europe and his theatre roots, determined only to come back to films when it suitably piqued his interest. He fulfilled that promise, perhaps to his career detriment. Having become one of the most esteemed young actor found on Western European stages, he hit international celebrity with his definitive portrayal of \"Hamlet\" in 1952, a role he would return to frequently. He returned to filming a few years later; four of his features were released in 1955. He played a German captain in the film [released in the States as The Last Ten Days of Hitler]; Lieutenant Baumgarten in the historical thriller [aka: Colonel Redl]; the title role in the romanticized biopic ; and the student in the drama . In 1957, he founded the Theatre Ensemble Oskar Werne, with which he performed in such productions as \"Bacchus.\" He would also return on occasion to the Burgtheater where he played \"Henry V\" and \"Prince Hal\" in \"Henry IV\". His interest in filming was not piqued again until 1962, when he became an international sensation alongside French star , in 's 'New Wave' cinematic masterpiece as the highly romantic and intellectual \"Jules\". He stood firm, however, despite the rash of critical kudos, and did not make a film again until four years later, earning an Oscar nomination for his tortured shipboard romance with (also nominated) in the glossy high seas drama . Notable for his roles of almost unbearable but restrained intensity, Werner furthered his film reputation by co-starring with and in the now- classic Cold War spy film, . Truffaut blessed him as well with another sterling role, in the futuristic classic , but the relationship between both of the men was irreparably damaged over artistic differences during filming. The unhappy experience Werner had during filming, triggered an already burgeoning drinking problem, and marked the start of decline of his career. Werner made only three films following the Truffaut affair, but the roles, as usual, were performed superbly. He played the suave and very-married symphony conductor who has an illicit affair with a reporter () in the tender remake of the / tearjerker ; he appeared as an unorthodox Jesuit priest in the all-star epic ; and boarded another WW II-era ship as German 's Jewish husband in the all-star feature, . Sadly, his longstanding problem with drink turned Oskar into a virtual recluse. Twice divorced (his second wife being , the adopted daughter of father, ) and mother, , Werner later had a son, Felix, from a 1966 liaison with American model Diane Anderson. His later years were spent traveling internationally, committing to poetry/pacifist readings, and occasionally performing on the stage. In 1967, he presented his one-man show 'An After-Dinner Evening with Oskar Werner', which was comprised of readings from the works of Schiller, Goethe and others. In 1970, he once-again toured with 'Hamlet'. His final stage appearance was in a 1983 production of 'The Prince of Homburg'. On the night of Monday, 22 October, 1984, Werner canceled a concert reading at a German drama club due to illness. The following day - 23 October, 1984 Werner was found dead by heart attack, at the age of 61. He was laid to rest in his adopted country of Liechtenstein. He passed away only two days after Truffaut."

    "description": "Two-time Oscar-winner Melvyn Douglas was one of America's finest actors, and would enjoy cinema immortality if for no other reason than his being the man who made Greta Garbo laugh in Ernst Lubitsch's classic comedy Ninotchka (1939), but he was much, much more. Melvyn Douglas was born Melvyn Edouard Hesselberg on April 5, 1901, in Macon, Georgia. His father, Edouard Gregory Hesselberg, a noted concert pianist and composer, was a Latvian Jewish emigrant, from Riga. His mother, Lena Priscilla (Shackelford), from Clark Furnace, Tennessee, was from a family with deep roots in the United States, and the daughter of Col. George Taliaferro Shackelford. Melvyn's father supported his family by teaching music at university-based conservatories. Melvyn dropped out of high school to pursue his dream of becoming an actor. He made his Broadway debut in the drama \"A Free Soul \" at the Playhouse Theatre on January 12, 1928, playing the role of a raffish gangster (a part that would later make 's career when the play was adapted to the screen as ). \"A Free Soul\" was a modest success, running for 100 performances. His next three plays were flops: \"Back Here\" and \"Now-a-Days\" each lasted one week, while \"Recapture\" lasted all of three before closing. He was much luckier with his next play, \"Tonight or Never,\" which opened on November 18, 1930, at legendary producer 's theater. Not only did the play run for 232 performances, but Douglas met the woman who would be his wife of nearly 50 years: his co-star, . They were married in 1931. The movies came a-calling in 1932 and Douglas had the unique pleasure of assaying completely different characters in widely divergent films. He first appeared opposite his future co-star in the screen adaptation of 's , proving himself a sophisticated leading man as, aside from his first-rate performance, he was able to shine in the light thrown off by Garbo, the cinema's greatest star. In typical Hollywood fashion, however, this terrific performance in a top-rank film from a major studio was balanced by his appearance in a low-budget horror film for the independent Mayfair studio, . However, the leading man won out, and that's how he first came to fame in the 1930s in such films as and Garbo's final film, . Douglas had shown he could play both straight drama and light comedy. Douglas was a great liberal and was a pillar of the anti-Nazi Popular Front in the Hollywood of the 1930s. A big supporter of President , he and his wife Helen were invited to spend a night at the White House in November 1939. Douglas' leftism would come back to haunt him after the death of FDR. Well-connected with the Roosevelt White House, Douglas served as a director of the Arts Council in the Office of Civilian Defense before joining the Army during World War II. He was very active in politics and was one of the leading lights of the anti-Communist left in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Douglas, who also was politically active, was elected to Congress from the 14th District in Los Angeles in 1944, the first of three terms. Returning to films after the war, Douglas' screen persona evolved and he took on more mature roles, in such films as ('s directorial debut) and . His political past caught up with him, however, in the late 1940s, and he - along with fellow liberals and (a registered Republican!) - were \"gray-listed\" (not explicitly blacklisted, they just weren't offered any work). Then there was the theater. Douglas made many appearances on Broadway in the 1940s and 1950s, including in a notable 1959 flop, making his musical debut playing Captain Boyle in 's \"Juno.\" The musical, based on 's play \"Juno and the Paycock\", closed in less than three weeks. Douglas was much luckier in his next trip to the post: he won a Tony for his Broadway lead role in the 1960 play \"The Best Man\" by . Douglas' evolution into a premier character actor was completed by the early 1960s. His years of movie exile seemed to deepen him, making him richer, and he returned to the big screen a more authoritative actor. For his second role after coming off of the graylist, he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar as 's father in . Other films in which he shined were 's , (a 1967 episode directed by called \"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\", for which he won a Best Actor Emmy) and , in which he played 's father. It was for his performance playing 's father that Douglas got his sole Best Actor Academy Award nod, in . He had a career renaissance in the late 1970s, appearing in , and . He won his second Oscar for \"Being There.\" Helen Gahagan Douglas died in 1980 and Melvyn followed her in 1981. He was 80 years old."

He never again saw his mother. The Peking Opera could be a brutal and grueling life for a child but he was a diligent and tireless student and he later received sponsorship to continue his education in the United States as a teenager. He attended Santa Ana Community College, where he met Nina Savino, an Asian American studying drama and art, and they married in 1972. Lone continued his education at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena and New York. They divorced in 1979. John once said that Ng, Lung and Lone were variants of \"dragon\" in different dialects of Chinese and that he intended to harness the power of the dragon for his life, which was why he adopted the stage name he would become known by. A theatrical workaholic, John became part of the East/West Players along with other notable Asian actors such as Mako, Sab Shimono and Soon Tek Oh. He performed in \"Pacific Overtures\" as the Lion Dancer and his discipline and talent blossomed. He danced, sang, wrote and directed. John signed with the then famous Bessie Loo Agency (most of the Asian talent of the day was represented by them). The early years of his career, consisted of small television roles, local theater and lots of study. His first real break came with the Di Laurentis remake of \"King Kong\" as the ships cook. It was followed by perhaps the most brilliant performance of his career - \"Iceman\" which was poignant and powerfully played without dialogue by Lone. The film opened the doors of his career to Michael Cimino (Year of the Dragon) and Bernardo Bertolucci (The Last Emperor) who made him a household name in the United States. Lone directed an acclaimed documentary on the Chinese Railroad workers in America which aired on PBS. He was voted one of the 50 most Beautiful People of the Year by People Magazine in 1990. The past decade he has spent his time between NY, China and Canada where he continues to act, direct, produce and he has even found time to nurture a singing career. An intensely private man, it is no wonder so many differing stories about his personal life abound unanswered. Perhaps the mystery of his persona is a large part of his attraction."

    "description": "Laurence Harvey was a British movie star who helped usher in the 1960s with his indelible portrait of a ruthless social climber, and became one of the decade's cultural icons for his appearances in socially themed motion pictures. Harvey was born Zvi Mosheh Skikne on October 1, 1928 in Joniskis, Lithuania, to Ella (Zotnickaita) and Ber Skikne. His family was Jewish. The youngest of three brothers, he emigrated with his family, to South Africa in 1934, and settled in Johannesburg. The teenager joined the South African army during World War II, and was assigned to the entertainment unit. His unit served in Egypt and Italy, and after the war the future Laurence Harvey returned to South Africa and began a career as an actor. He moved to London after winning a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. He then did his apprenticeship in regional theatre, moving to Manchester in the 1940s. The tyro actor reportedly supported himself as a hustler while appearing with the city's Library Theatre. Even at this point in his life he was known to be continually in debt and adopted a firm belief in living beyond his means, a pattern that would continue until his premature death. His lifestyle would often dictate working on less worthy projects for the sake of a paycheck. His film debut came in , and he was soon signed by Associated British Studios. His early film roles proved underwhelming, and his attempt to become a stage star was disastrous - his debut in the revival of \"Hassan\" was a notorious flop. After failing in the commercial theater in London's West End, Harvey joined the company of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon for the 1952 season. Regularly panned by critics during his stint on the boards in the Bard's works, he built up his reputation as a personality by becoming combative, telling the press that he was a great actor despite the bad reviews. Someone was listening, as Romulus Pictures signed him in 1953 and began building him up as a star. Harvey was cast as Romeo in , a film that exemplified the main problem that kept Harvey from major stardom (but subsequently would serve him quite well in a handful of roles): his screen persona was emotionally aloof if not downright frigid. Despite his icy portrayal of the great romantic hero Romeo, Harvey attracted enough attention in Hollywood to be brought over by Warner Bros. and given a lead role in . In Old Blighty with Romulus after his Hollywood adventure, Harvey met his future wife on the set of . Other film appearances included and , the latter becoming his first certified hit, and even greater success was to come. The colorful Harvey, a press favorite, became notorious for his high-spending, high-living ways. He found himself frequently in debt, his travails faithfully reported by entertainment columnists. More fame was to come. After making three flops in a row, Harvey began a brief reign as the Jack the Lad of British cinema with the great success of . That film and , which was also released that year, inaugurated the \"kitchen sink\" school of British cinema that revolutionized the country's film industry and that of its cousin, Hollywood, in the 1960s. Harvey was born to play Joe Lampton, if not in kin, then in kind. Lampton was a working-class bloke who dreams of escaping his social strata for something better. It was a perfect match of actor and role, as the icy Harvey persona made Joe's ruthless ambition to climb the greasy pole of success fittingly chilling. In bringing Joe to life on the screen, Harvey was more successful than (a far better actor) had been in limning the theater's Jimmy Porter in the film adaptation of 's seminal \"Look Back in Anger,\" despite Burton's own working-class background. Burton's volcanic use of his mellifluous voice, a great instrument, is much too hot for the the small universe on the screen, a case of projection that is so intense that it overwhelms the character and the film (it took Burton another half-decade to learn to act on film, and a half-decade more to lose that gift). Whereas Burton had to learn to rein it in, Harvey's already tightly controlled persona made the social-climbing Lampton resonate. Harvey fits the skin of the character much better than does Burton. Despite not being an authentic specimen, the success of his performance as a working-class man-on-the-make proved to be the vanguard of a new generation of screen characters that would be played by the real thing: , , and , among others. \"Room at the Top\" signaled the appearance of the New Wave of British cinema. For his role as Joe, Harvey received his first (and only) Academy Award nomination. While historically significant, \"Room at the Top\" is no longer ranked at the summit of other, more contemporary kitchen-sink dramas, such as 's , 's and 's , or even 's provincial comedy , films that made stars out of the authentic working-class/provincial actors Finney, , and Courtenay, respectively. The virtue of the film is its emotional honesty about the manipulation of personal relationships for social gain in postwar Britain, a system that after a decade under the Conservatives had become self-satisfied and complacent. In its portrayal of class warfare, the film offers the most intense critique of the British class system offered by any film from the British New Wave, including \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,\" which never leaves the confines of the working-class strata its main character, Arthur Seaton, is stuck in and ultimately reconciled to. That Joe chooses a woman other than the one he really loves in order to gain social mobility, engaging in emotional manipulation of other human beings, is a brutal indictment of the class structure of postwar Britain. Joe, on his way to his wedding and his great chance, has lost his humanity. His failure is symbolic of Britain's failure as well. It is the haughtiness and narcissism of the actor Harvey (qualities his screen persona engenders in film after film) that elucidates Lampton's weakness. A further irony of Harvey's effective, if ersatz, portrayal of working-class Joe is that it made him such a success - he soon went off to Hollywood to play opposite box-office titan in , thus losing out on further opportunities to appear in the British New Wave he helped introduce. As well as supporting Taylor in her Oscar-winning turn in \"Butterfield 8\" (the two became close friends), a badly miscast Harvey also co-starred as Texas hero Col. James Travis in 's bloated budget-buster . With the exception of the lead in the British - a war picture that was decidedly NOT New Wave - Harvey did not appear again in a major British film until 1965, when he returned to the other side of the pond to reprise Joe in the \"Room\" sequel . However, if he had never gone Hollywood, he might never have been cast in his other signature role: Raymond Shaw, the eponymous . Once again, the match of actor and character was ideal, as Harvey's coldness and affect-free acting perfectly embodied the persona of the programmed assassin. The film, and Harvey's performance in it, are classic. In this Hollywood interlude, Harvey also appeared in the screen adaptations of ' opposite the great , Oscar-nominated for her role, and the artistically less successful , supported by the legendary , French beauty and a young . The critics were less kind to his acting in these outings, and, indeed, the rather elegant Harvey does seem miscast as Dove Linkhorn, the wandering Texan created by hardboiled , reduced to working in an automotive garage by the exigencies of the Great Depression. Critics were even less kind when Harvey tried to follow in 's footsteps in the remake of . Although he could not know it then, Harvey had reached the zenith of his career. In 1962 he won the Best Actor prize at the Munich film festival in 1962 for his role in . Honors for Harvey were few after this point. He co-starred with and in 's film version of the Broadway re-envisioning of 's cinematic masterpiece . The result, , in which Newman played a murderous Mexican bandit and Harvey his victim, was an unqualified flop that still boggles the mind of viewers unfortunate enough to stumble upon it, so outrageous is the idea of casting Newman as a Mexican killer (a role originated by on the Broadway stage). Harvey, very often a wooden presence in his less inspired performances, was appropriately upstaged by the tree he remained tied to throughout most of the film. Along with \"Life at the Top,\" Harvey appeared in support of Oscar-winner in John Schlesinger's , an allegedly \"mod\" look at the jaded and superficial existence of what was then termed the \"jet set.\" Despite its \"New Wave\"-like cutting and visual sense, \"Darling\" - which was embraced wholeheartedly by Hollywood and originally had been envisioned as a vehicle for - was, at its heart, an old-fashioned Hollywood-style morality play, a warning that the wages of sin lead to emotional emptiness, hardy a revolutionary idea in 1965. Christie was excellent - particularly as she metamorphosed from Dolly-bird to a more mature sort of hustler - and first-male lead always proved an interesting actor, but it was Harvey who most clearly embodied the zeitgeist of the picture. Once again, his coldness did him well as he limned the executive who manipulates and is manipulated by Christie's Diana character. Harvey had become at this point a kind of good-luck charm for actresses with whom he appeared. , Elizabeth Taylor and Christie won Best Actress Oscars after appearing in films with him, and Geraldine Page and \"Room at the Top\" co-star were both Oscar-nominated in the period after appearing opposite Harvey. Alas, no one else collected kudos in a Harvey picture: he reached the high-water mark of his career in 1962, and his star was already in in decline to a murkier, less-lustrous part of the Hollywood/international cinema firmament. Another irony of Harvey's career is that, despite ushering in the British New Wave and a cinema more independent of the meat-grinder ethos of the Hollywood and British studios catering to popular taste, he would have been better served in the 1930s and 1940s as a contract player at a major studio. Like (who also became the third husband of Harvey's first wife, Margaret Leighton), another handsome man of limited gifts who nonetheless could be quite affecting in the right role, Harvey's career likely would have thrived under the studio system, with an interested boss to guide him. Like Minniver Cheever, however, he was unfortunate to have been born after his time. As it was, the next (and last) decade of Harvey's screen life was a disappointment, with the actor relegated to less and less prestigious pictures and international co-productions that needed a \"star\" name. In the 1970s, Harvey became largely irrelevant as a player in the motion picture industry. His luck had run out. Good friend Liz Taylor, whose string of motion picture successes had also run its course, had him cast in , and he directed the last picture in which he appeared, . If he had lived, he might have made the transition to director (he had earlier directed and finished directing after the death of original director ). Laurence Harvey died on November 25, 1973, from stomach cancer. He publicly revealed that he was dismayed by being afflicted with the fatal disease, as he had always been careful with the way he ate. Sadly, his personal luck, just as capricious as his professional career, had also gone into eclipse. One of the more colorful characters to grace the screen was dead at the age of 45, exiting the stage far too soon for the legions of fans that still admired him despite the downturn in his fortunes."

But his passion was elsewhere and he soon did the splits appearing as a chorus boy in music-hall revues. Leaving Aix for Paris, with a letter of recommendation signed by Huguette Duflos, he found work at once, at the Trianon first, and then at the ABC in a show by realistic singer . He also appeared in Pigalle nightclubs. In 1939, fell in love with him and both spent long months together. As \"la Môme Piaf\" did not think much of his singing talent (he had specialized in singing cheerful songs in a gloomy tone) she urged him to become an actor, which he did in being her partner in Jean Cocteau's play \"Le bel Indifférent\", even if it was in ... a silent role. From then on, his activity on stage as well as in films never ceased until his untimely death at age 66, following an acute attack of asthma. In the theater he played either in very successful light comedies by , , or or in classics by Shakespeare or Shaw. He belonged to the Comédie Française company for 27 months. On the night before he passed away, he was still triumphing in 's \"Mon Père avait Raison\". Most of the first films he made were mediocre but things improved in the 1950 to star in , in which he played to perfection a cruel, obnoxious husband. An unforgettable interpretation indeed, but Meurisse also appeared in a fistful of interesting movies directed by Duvivier (), Renoir () and Melville ( and ). On the other hand, Meurisse proved unique and irreplaceable in a series of parodic spy movies hemmed by (, and ) as Commandant Theobald Dromard aka \"Le Monocle\", gracing these unpretentious films with distinction, composure and irony.

While other actors strive to close in on life, Kaas - who experienced tragic loss at an early age - seems eager to escape the eye of the storm. It is a disturbing quality that etches his characters in the audience's mind. Kaas graduated from the National Theater School in Denmark in 1998. He first appeared on screen in 's film (The Boys from Sct. Petri) in 1991 as Otto, the rebel son of a traitor. The development of the character illustrates the growth of moral resistance into full-fledged violent revolt. This somber and masterfully-acted part earned Kaas two Danish film prizes, a Robert and a Bodil. Today Kaas imbues his adult characters with the unsentimental innocence and vulnerability of a child and audiences respond intuitively. Jeppe in 's takes on true love, only to lose it. The actor received another Bodil for this portrayal. Kaas makes a narrow escape from type-casting by adding original qualities to the individual characters. He has also done self-parody as a happy-go-easy cook, working for a mafia-like boss in the midst of a murderous streak in (In China They Eat Dogs) and as a helpless man in the throes of love in (Blinking Lights). After imbuing smaller parts with larger-than-life performances, Kaas landed another main part in as Ahmed, the aborted son (!) of a working couple. His would-be little sister is the emotionally neglected Lisa. When she dies, Ahmed comes to life and tries to become a real human being. Kaas delivers another masterful performance in this movie, inspired by the tragic tale of Casper Hauser."

    "description": "Despite many a powerful performance, this actor's actor never quite achieved the stardom he deserved. Ultimately, Richard Basehart became best-known to television audiences as Admiral Harriman Nelson, commander of the glass-nosed nuclear submarine 'S.S.R.N Seaview' in Irwin Allen's Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1964), shown on ABC from 1964 to 1968. Basehart's distinctively deep, resonant voice also provided narrations in feature films, TV mini-series and for documentaries. Born in Zanesville, Ohio, on August 14 1914, Basehart was one of four siblings born to a struggling and soon-to-be widowed editor of a local newspaper. Upon leaving college, he worked briefly as a radio announcer and then attempted to follow in his father's journalistic footsteps as a reporter. Controversy over one of his stories led to his departure from the paper and cleared the path to pursue acting as a career. In 1932, Basehart made his theatrical bow with the Wright Players Stock Company in his home town and subsequently spent five years playing varied and interesting roles at the Hedgerow Theatre in Philadelphia. From 1938, he began to work in New York on and off-Broadway. Seven years later he received the New York Drama Critics Circle Best Newcomer Award for \"The Hasty Heart\", a drama by , in which Basehart played a dying Scottish soldier. In 1945, he received his first film offers. When he heard director Bretaigne Windust was seeking an authentic Scot for the lead role in The Hasty Heart, Basehart not only effected an authentic enough burr to win the part, but won also the 1945 New York Critic's Award as the most promising actor of the year. His accent was so good that a visiting leader of a Scottish clan told the actor he knew his clan. Basehart made his debut on the big screen with at Eagle-Lion, a minor film noir with , followed at Warner Brothers with the Gothic thriller . His third picture finally got him critical plaudits for playing a sociopathic killer, relentlessly hunted through drainage tunnels in , a procedural police drama shot in a semi-documentary style. Variety gave a positive review, commenting \"With this role, Basehart establishes himself as one of Hollywood's most talented finds in recent years. He heavily overshadows the rest of the cast...\" It was the first of many charismatic performances in which Basehart would excel at tormented or introverted characters, portraying angst, foreboding or mental anguish. His gallery of characters came to include the notorious Robespierre, chief architect of the , set during the French Revolution. He was one of the feuding Hatfields in and in (based on a real 1938 Manhattan suicide) had a tour de force turn as a man perched on the high ledge of an office building threatening to jump. For much of the film's duration, the camera was firmly focused on the actor's face. Basehart later recalled \"It was an actor's dream, in which I hogged the camera lens, and the role called on me to act mostly with my eyes, lips and face muscles\". The New York Times reviewer called his performance 'startling and poignant'. Eschewing conventional movie stardom, Basehart meticulously selected and varied his roles, avoiding, as he put it, \"stereotyping at the expense of not amassing an impressive bank account.'' In the wake of the sudden death of his first wife, Basehart left the U.S. for Italy. In March 1951, he got married a second time (to the actress ) and appeared in a succession of European movies, playing the ill-fated clown Il Matto in 's classic ; against type, essayed a swashbuckling nobleman reclaiming his titles and estate in , and (again for Fellini), played a member of a gang of grifters in . He was also ideally cast as the mild-mannered Ishmael in 's excellent version of and as Ivan, one of . By 1960, Basehart's second marriage had ended in divorce and the actor returned to America where he found movie opportunities few and far between. The small screen to some extent reinvigorated his career with numerous series guest appearances and his lengthy stint in the popular Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. He also received critical praise for his role as Henry Wirtz, commandant of the Confederacy's most infamous prison camp, in the Emmy and Peabody Award-winning television drama . Not only an active human rights campaigner, Basehart was also strongly opposed to the experimental use of animals. With his third wife Diana Lotery he set up the animal welfare charity, Actors and Others for Animals, in 1971. He died after suffering a series of strokes in Los Angeles on September 17 1984 at the age of 70."

He has built a unique filmography that distinguishes him from other actors of the same age, playing a series of impressive characters in films and TV series. Not only is he known as an icon of youth in Korea, but also he has made remarkable achievements in numerous industry awards. Yoo is representing his generation by focusing on the growth of the characters he portrays, which is leading him to gain applause from the public. Yoo was born Uhm Hong-sik on October 6, 1986, in Daegu, Korea, as the youngest of three children. In the first year of high school majoring in fine arts, he was discovered by a casting agent in front of the school and came up to Seoul by himself to attend auditions. In 2003, He made his debut in a TV commercial for noodles under the current stage name of Yoo Ah-in. He then started to appear in teen-series and garnered a huge popularity from teenagers. After that, however, he halted his activities for one year to think about his identity and the path of acting without being influenced by popularity. Returning with independent film and family-comedy , he attracted a lot of attention of critics and viewers as a promising newcomer. Yoo went on to win Best New Actor from the Busan Film Critics Association and was nominated at the Blue Dragon Film Awards. Also, he had played various roles across films and TV series, such as a lonely assassin in , a patisserie aspirant and former boxer in , a young assistant at the architectural office in , and a pizza delivery man in . In 2010, Yoo rose to prominence when he starred in , creating a syndrome called 'Geol-oh Love Sickness', which earned him praise as a unique actor in his generation. He was then cast in the coming-of-age film , met with critical and commercial success, thereby cementing his status as screen star. This was followed by the first nomination for Best Actor in his career. Since then, he had gone on to star in a wide spectrum of works, including , , and . In 2014, Yoo played a genius pianist who falls in love in melodrama , where he actually played the piano. His performance was much appreciated by musical performers, critics and audiences. The next year, he achieved considerable critical and public acclaim for his brilliant portrayals of both the villain in big-hit action film and a tragic prince in historical film . This also led to gaining wider recognition as an established actor when he acted the protagonist in 50 episodes of for six months. During this period, as he gained a huge popularity and received various accolades from prestigious awards, the media called this phenomenon 'Ah-in Era'. Especially, he won the Best Actor award in the Blue Dragon Film Awards, which means that he is the first actor to win in this category under 30 in fifteen years. Later, he took a shot to romantic comedy in the ensemble film . The following year, he starred in fantasy TV series , where he played the double roles of a 2017 renowned writer and a leader of a resistance group in mid-1930s. In 2018, Yoo featured in a critically acclaimed film that premiered in Cannes and later made the headlines for being the first Korean film to make it into the final shortlist for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Yoo gained international recognition, with The New York Times including him in its end-of-year roundup of best actors and Forbes seeing in him an up-and-coming star to watch. The same year, he starred in the financial drama , taking over the role of a young stockbroker who predicts national bankruptcy in 1997 and bets on it. While Yoo has been pretty busy in a couple of years with his other activities such as running a art gallery, producing a talk show and proclaiming the resolution of peace, he made a brilliant comeback in 2020 when he headlined , which became the first hit film in South Korea since COVID-19 hit the film industry and the first Korean film to top Netflix movies worldwide chart.

Also, Yoo became the second actor to win Best Actor twice before 40 at the Blue Dragon Film Awards, and the first actor born after the 1980s to win Best Actor in both film and TV categories at the Baeksang Arts Awards. His next roles will be those of a cult leader in Netflix series , a Go player in biopic film , a ordinary man with superpower in fantasy comedy , and a drift driver in crime action .

This allows him to acquire an unconventional image of an artist who is questioning the world and the youth who is constantly seeking answers. He is also interested in the welfare of children and adolescents, such as writing a public letter to encourage participation in donation or creating a fund named after him as well as holding the charitable campaigns through his art studio. He has written poems personally and contributed articles to magazines. In addition, he is known as a fashionista and has caused a great sensation with the design of combination of Korean and English.

He was leading man to Greta Garbo in The Kiss (1929), but it was the role of Paul Baumer in All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) that was his big break. He was profoundly affected by the anti-war message of that film, and when, in 1942, the popular star of and subsequent Dr. Kildare films was drafted, he was a conscientious objector. America was outraged, and theaters vowed never to show his films again, but quietly he achieved the Medical Corps status he had requested, serving as a medic under fire in the South Pacific and as a chaplain's aid in New Guinea and the Phillipines. His return to film after the war was undistinguished until - his role as the sympathetic physician treating the deaf-mute won him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Subsequent movie roles were scarce; an opportunity to play Dr. Kildare in television was aborted when the network refused to honor his request for no cigarette sponsorship. He continued to act, but in the 1970s put his long experience into a project to bring to the west the philosophy of the East - the resulting film, , while not a box-office success, won critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award. Lew Ayres died in Los Angeles, California on December 30, 1996, just two days after his 88th birthday."

    "description": "Acting chameleon Sir Tom Courtenay, along with Sir Alan Bates and Albert Finney, became a front-runner in an up-and-coming company of rebel upstarts who created quite a stir in British \"kitchen sink\" cinema during the early '60s. An undying love for the theatre, however, had Courtenay channeling a different course from the aforementioned greats and he never, by his own choosing, attained comparable cinematic stardom. The gaunt and glum, fair-haired actor was born Thomas Daniel Courtenay into modest surroundings on February 25, 1937, in Hull, East Yorkshire, England, the son of Thomas Henry Courtenay, a ship painter, and his wife, Anne Eliza (née Quest). Graduating from Kingston High School there, he trained in drama at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. His reputation as an actor grew almost immediately with his professional debut in 1960 as Konstantin in \"The Seagull\" at the Old Vic. Following tours in Scotland and London with the play, Tom performed in \"Henry IV, Part I\" and \"Twelfth Night\" (also at the Old Vic) before assuming the title role of Billy from in the critically acclaimed drama \"Billy Liar\" at the Cambridge Theatre in 1961. The story, which tells of a Yorkshire man who creates a fantasy world to shield himself from his mundane middle-class woes, was the initial spark in Tom's rise to fame. The recognition he received landed him squarely into the heap of things as a new wave of \"angry young men\" were taking over British cinema during the swinging '60s. Singled out for his earlier stage work at RADA, he was eventually handed the title role in the war film , but it was his second movie that clinched stardom. Winning the role of Colin Smith in , Courtenay invested everything he had in this bruising portrayal of youthful desolation and rebellion. As a reform school truant whose solitary sentencing for robbing a bakery leads to a reawakening and subsequent recognition as a long distance runner, he was awarded a \"Promising Newcomer\" award from the British Film Academy, It was Courtenay then, and not Finney, who recreated his stage triumph as Billy Fisher in the stark film version of . British Film Academy nominations came his way for this and for his fourth movie role in . Vivid contributions to the films , the ever-popular , which earned him his first Oscar nomination, and followed. Despite all this cinematic glory, Courtenay did not enjoy the process of movie-making and reverted to his first passion -- the theatre -- beginning in 1966. Displaying his versatility with roles in such classic works as \"The Cherry Orchard,\" \"Macbeth\" (as Malcolm), \"Charley's Aunt,\" \"The Playboy of the Western World,\" \"Hamlet,\" \"She Stoops to Conquer,\" \"Peer Gynt\" and \"Arms and the Man,\" he still found scattered work in films, including , and , but none matched his earlier brilliance. In 1971 he took a self-imposed, decade-long sabbatical from filming. Forming a sturdy association with the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester that would last over a decade, he continued to impress with lead roles in \"The Rivals\" and \"The Prince of Homburg\". Following his huge success as the libidinous Norman in \"The Norman Conquests\" in London, he made his Broadway debut with \"Otherwise Engaged\" (1977) and earned a Tony nomination and Drama League Award in the process. It was his second Tony-nominated triumph in \"The Dresser\" in 1980-1981, however, that lured Courtenay back to films when he was asked to recreate the role for the large screen. co-starred Tom as the mincing personal assistant to an appallingly self-destructive stage star played by ( played the role with Tom on Broadway) who struggles to get the actor through a rigorous performance of \"King Lear\". Both British actors received Oscar nominations but lost the 1984 \"Best Actor\" award to American . Since then Tom has appeared on occasion in TV and film roles -- usually in support. A few standouts include the films , , and , as well as the TV mini-series , for which he earned a British Television Award, and the series for which he won a BAFTA award. Over the years Sir Tom has excelled in solo stage shows as well. As a chronic alcoholic in \"Moscow Stations,\" he won the 1994 London Critics Circle Theatre and London Evening Standard Theatre awards for \"Best Actor.\" In 2002, he wrote the one-man show \"Pretending To Be Me,\" based on the letters and writings of poet Philip Larkin. In the past decade he has continued to distinguish himself on both the classical (\"King Lear,\" \"Uncle Vanya\") and contemporary (\"Art\") stages. Courtenay's marriage to actress lasted about a decade (from 1973 to 1982). In 1988 he married Isabel Crossley, a stage manager at the Royal Exchange Theatre in London. He has no children from either marriage. In 1999, Sir Tom Courtenay was awarded an honorary doctorate from Hull University and in 2000 published his memoir \"Dear Tom: Letters From Home\", which earned strong reviews. Knighthood came a year after that."

    "description": "Though his number of film roles amount to a bit over 30, Paul Scofield has cast a giant shadow in the world of stage and film acting. He grew up in West Sussex, the son of a schoolmaster. He attended the Varndean School for Boys in Brighton. The love of acting came early. While still high school age, he began training as an actor at the Croydon Repertory Theatre School (1939) and then at the Mask Theatre School (1940) in London. He took on all the experience he could handle by joining touring companies and also entertained British troops during World War II. He joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and, from there in 1946, he moved to Stratford-upon-Avon. There, in the birthplace of , he had his first great successes. He had the title role in \"Henry V\"; he was \"Cloten\" in \"Cymbeline\"; \"Don Adriano de Armado\" in \"Love's Labour's Lost\", \"Lucio\" in \"Measure for Measure\", and then \"Hamlet\". And there were many more as he honed himself into one the great Shakespearean actors of the 20th century. With a rich, sonorous voice compared to a Rolls Royce being started up, in one instance, and a great sound rumbling forth from an antique crypt in yet another, he was quickly compared to . Scofield did not move on to commercial theater until 1949, when he took the lead role of \"Alexander the Great\", in playwright 's unfortunately ill-received \"Adventure Story\". And as he continued theater work, he moved toward film very carefully. From his first in 1955, Scofield was always - as with any of his acting assignments - extremely picky about accepting a particular role. It was three years before his second film. Meanwhile, Scofield had the opportunity to play a great lead part in a new play by a schoolmaster-turned-new-playwright, . The play was \"A Man for All Seasons\" and Scofield's choice role was that of \"Sir Thomas More\", the great English humanist and chancellor, who defied the ogre \"King Henry VIII\" in his wish to put aside his first wife for \"Anne Bolyne\". It was a once in a lifetime part, and Scofield debuted it in London in 1960. His only appearance on Broadway was the next year in that play, which ran into 1962. It was no surprise that the work began garnering awards for him (see Trivia below for details on theater and film awards). He returned to Shakespeare in 1962 with , the noted British director and producer, directing him as \"Lear\" at the newly formed Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at Stratford. This was a pioneering minimalist production, one of the first \"bare stage\" efforts - though things were pretty bare stage in Shakespeare's day. Scofield then did \"Coriolanus\" and \"Love's Labour's Lost\" for the Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario in 1963. His third film came six years after his second screen appearance (1958). This was his standout performance in , a production of his co-star, , that grew in size and budget with the entrance of Lancaster's second choice for director, . Some of the difficulties involved might have turned someone of Scofield's discipline back to the stage thereafter, but the filming of \"Seasons\" arrived, and he would hardly refuse. With handling the screenplay and a superlative supporting cast, the film version of collected some thirty-three international awards, including a three-statue sweep of prime-Oscar categories plus another three for good measure. Scofield was unforgettable as the incisive man of state, able to juggle the volatile politics of the time but always keep his honor and so brimming with faith as to endure the inevitably mounting tide against him. It suited Scofield for a time to keep his screen-acting to adaptations of plays, books, and ensemble pieces fitted to the big screen. and he teamed again for a film version of the Brook-adapted play . The adaptation of 's , despite Scofield's efforts, did not wash as an attempt to update Melville's story in the late twentieth century. Then Brook was back again to finally attempt what he said had really never been done correctly -adapting Shakespeare to film. Scofield's 1962 \"Lear\" was held in high esteem, and Brook decided on a film version, , an even more uncompromising, even uncomfortable, desolation staging and editing of the tragedy. Despite some oddball camera work and not wholly satisfying adapting of the play, Scofield was magnificent and got his chance to show that he is perhaps the best Lear of modern times. While still keeping a concerted interest in filmed play adaptations, Scofield could be lured into more typical screen drama. He joined former co-star, , for the spy thriller, , as a memorable Russian comrade of Lancaster from the days of World War II, caught in late-Cold War spy craft brutality. Through the 1980s, Scofield did a mix of TV and film on both sides of the Atlantic. But he was drawn back to Shakespeare and filming efforts, though in humbler parts, first in the of ambitious , as the French king, and, the next year, in the , , as \"The Ghost\" - with the real buzz being for as the dour \"Prince of Denmark\". Both films were well-crafted with impressive supporting casts. And Scofield could be content that as with all his roles, he was remaining consistent with himself as his own best judge of how to challenge his acting gifts. Gibson was appropriately awed, saying that working with Scofield was like being \"thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson\" (that is, then, not now). Through the 1990s, he enjoyed his continued sampling of all acting media, even radio narration and animation voice-over. The matter of British actors weighing upon the acceptance of knighthoods for their work began most publicly with Scofield. In 1956, after his tour of \"Hamlet\" with a triumph in Moscow, he gratefully accepted the appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), but thereafter he refused on three occasions the offer of knighthood. \"If you want a title, what's wrong with Mr.? If you have always been that, then why lose your title? \"I have a title, which is the same one that I have always had. But it's not political. I have a CBE, which I accepted very gratefully\". He said this with great simplicity and charm. The matter of 'theatrical nobility' has prompted others to follow Scofield's example. One high profile example with a twist is actor , now an American citizen, who quipped that he only accepted the knighthood because his wife wanted him to do so. In taking the oath of citizenship, Hopkins pledged to \"renounce the title of nobility to which I have heretofore belonged\". But Scofield's demeanor in his logically crafted refusals from the first so fit this man's very private life. Yet quite averse to being interviewed, he has always been considerate to the public for their patronage. Brilliant man and acting legacy, on and off the stage, Paul Scofield truly is a \"Man for All Seasons\"."

After playing the part for nine years, he moved on to star in his own series, Kentucky Jones (1964). However, the show failed to find mass appeal and was cancelled after just one season. Weaver had to wait another five years before finally emerging as a TV star in his own right. Beginning in 1971, he portrayed the titular Marshal Sam McCloud, a lawman from Taos, New Mexico, working in New York to learn the ways of policing in Manhattan's 27th Precinct under the auspices of a frequently apoplectic Chief of Detectives, Peter Clifford (). Accented in a slow Texan drawl (his regular catchphrase was \"There you go..\") and decked out with cowboy hat, lasso and sheepskin jacket, McCloud went about his tasks pretty much the same way he would have done out in the West -- often to the chagrin of his boss, nevertheless always apprehending the villain in the end (sometimes on horseback). His fractious relationship with Clifford provided much of the enjoyment inherent in the show. Weaver later recalled \"McCloud was the kind of role I left Gunsmoke to get... I wanted to be a leading man instead of a second banana.\" Between 1971 and 1977, (based in part on the film ) was part of Universal's \"Mystery Movie\" which filled a slot at NBC with films lasting from 74 to 97 minutes (longer than your average TV episode) and which rotated several productions, the most important being (), (), () and (). Weaver hailed from Joplin, Missouri, where his father (who was of mixed English, Irish, Scottish, Cherokee, and Osage ancestry) worked for the local electric company. Young Dennis proved himself a gifted track and field athlete while studying for a degree in fine arts at the University of Oklahoma. During World War II, he served as a fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy. After the war, Weaver forsook sports for a career on the stage, undertaking further drama classes at the Actor's Studio in New York. One of his fellow alumni was actress who later helped him to get into films. Following his Broadway debut in \"Come Back, Little Sheba\", Weaver found work in plays by off-Broadway and then made his movie debut at Universal in the western . He made several more pictures, mostly westerns, but was largely cast in minor roles. He languished in relative obscurity until he landed several guest spots on 's . His career really took off with McCloud and with the -directed , a thriller made for the small screen (essentially a one-man show) in which a lone driver is menaced by a sinister petrol tanker driven by an unseen force. He later found other regular television work (, and ), but none of these managed to recapture his earlier successes. In , he was true to his colors, playing western hero , a.k.a. Buffalo Bill. Weaver served as President of the Screen Actors Guild from 1973 to 1975. He was in the forefront of environmental activism, a proponent of alternative energy and recycling (his Colorado home, called \"Earthship\", was primarily constructed from recycled tires and aluminium cans)."

The hospital was bombed and buried Kier and his mother in the rubble. Both survived, and Kier would later move to London as a young adult to study English. Kier was discovered in London by Michael Sarne, who cast him in his first role as a gigolo in \"Road To Saint Tropez\". Kier then starred in Michael Armstrong's extremely controversial \"Mark Of The Devil\". He would go on to work with Paul Morrissey in Andy Warhol's \"Flesh For Frankenstein\" and \"Blood For Dracula\", Dario Argento in \"Suspiria\", and Rainer Werner Fassbinder in \"The Third Generation\", \"Lili Marllen\", and \"Lola\". Kier entered the American independent cinema scene many years later after meeting Gus Van Sant at the Berlin Film Festival. Van Sant offered Kier the role of Hans, the lamp-singing john in \"My Own Private Idaho\" with Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix. He would later have roles in Gus Van Sant's \"Even Cowgirls Get The Blues\" and \"Don't Worry He Won't Get Far On Foot\" as well as such 90s Hollywood hits as \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\", \"Johnny Mnemonic\", \"Barb Wire\", \"End Of Violence\", \"For Love Or Money\", \"Armagedden\", \"Blade\", and \"End Of Days\".

    "description": "The award-worthy actor, now enjoying an over five decade career, has a resume that includes everything from Shakespeare to Seinfeld -- from the villainous Senator on Ozark to the wise judge on Lincoln Lawyer. Born on June 28, 1946, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Clair, an architect and musician, and Marian (Holman) Davison, a secretary, Bruce's parents divorced when he was just three. He developed a burgeoning interest in acting while majoring in art at Penn State and after accompanying a friend to a college theater audition. Making his professional stage debut in 1966 as Jonathan in \"Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Bad\" at the Pennsylvania Festival Theatre, he made it to Broadway within just a couple of years (1968) with the role of Troilus in \"Tiger at the Gates\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre. The year after that he was seen off-Broadway in \"A Home Away from Home\" and appeared at the Lincoln Center in the cast of \"King Lear.\" Success in the movies came immediately for the perennially youthful-looking actor after he and a trio of up-and-coming talents ( [then known as Barbara Seagull], and ) starred together in the poignant but disturbing coming-of-age film . From this he was awarded a starring role opposite in , an offbeat social commentary about 60s college radicalism, and in the cult horror flick in which he bonded notoriously with a herd of rats. Moving further into the 70s decade, his film load did not increase significantly as expected and the ones he did appear in were no great shakes. With the exception of his co-starring role alongside in the well-made cavalry item and the powerful low-budget in which he played a child molester, Bruce's film roles were underwhelming, such as his elder Patrick Dennis in the musical film version of , as well as , , and . As such, Bruce wisely looked elsewhere for rewarding work and found it on the stage and on the smaller screen. Earning strong theatrical roles in \"The Skin of Our Teeth,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Life in the Theatre,\" he won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for his work in \"Streamers\" in 1977. On TV, he scored in mini-movie productions of , (portraying Dean Torrence of the surf-era pop duo Jan and Dean) and, most of all, co-starring as a German prisoner of war in the American South who falls for a lonely Jewish-American girl. In 1972 Bruce married actress who appeared briefly as a college student in and later became a daytime soap opera fixture. The marriage was quickly annulled the following year. The 1980s was also dominated by strong theater performances. Bruce took over the role of the severely deformed John Merrick as \"The Elephant Man\" on Broadway; portrayed Clarence in \"Richard III\" at the New York Shakespeare Festival; was directed by in \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial\"; played a moving Tom Wingfield opposite 's Amanda in \"The Glass Menagerie\"; received a second Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for his work in the AIDS play \"The Normal Heart\"; and finished off the decade gathering up fine reviews in the amusing period piece \"The Cocktail Hour\". While hardly lacking for work on film (, , , and ), few of them made use of his talents and range. It was not until he was cast in the ground-breaking gay drama that his film career revitalized. Giving a quiet, finely nuanced, painfully tender performance as the middle-aged lover and caretaker of a life partner ravaged by AIDS, Bruce managed to stand out amid the strong ensemble cast and earn himself an Oscar nomination for \"Best Supporting Actor\". Although he lost out to the flashier antics of in the mob drama that year, Bruce was not overlooked -- copping Golden Globe, Independent Spirit, New York Film Critics and National Society of Film Critics awards. Other gay-themed films also welcomed his presence, including and . The actor eventually served as a spokesperson for a host of AIDS-related organizations, including Hollywood Supports, and has been active with foundations that assist abused children. Bruce has been all over the screen since his success in . Predominantly seen as mature, morally responsible dads and politicians, his genial good looks and likability have on occasion belied a weak or corrupt heart. Bruce married actress in 1986 and they have one son, Ethan, born in 1996. (). Popular films have included starring , the family adventure film and the box-office hit and its sequel in the role of Senator Kelly. More controversial art-house showcases include , as serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's father, and , as a bigoted, murderous pastor. Into the millennium, Bruce has played mature gents and several high-level officials in such films as , , , , , , , Divorced from second wife , Bruce is happily married to Michele Correy and has a daughter with her, Sophia Lucy, born in 2006. They live in the Los Angeles area."

His incredibly long surnames led him to select the shortest surname he could find extant (\"Lom\") and adopt it as his own, professionally. He made his film debut in the Czech film Woman Below the Cross (1937) and played supporting and, occasionally, lead roles. His career picked up in the 1940s and he played, among other roles, Napoleon Bonaparte in and in . In a rare starring role, Lom played twin trapeze artists in . He continued into the 1950s with roles opposite and in , and , and in . His career really took off in the 1960s and he got the title role in Hammer Films' production of . He also played \"Captain Nemo\" in and landed supporting parts in and an especially showy role in as a pirate chieftain contracted to transport Spartacus' army away from Italy. The 1960s was also the decade in which Lom secured the role for which he will always be remembered: Clouseau/' long-suffering boss, Commissioner Charles Dreyfus, in the \"Pink Panther\" films, in which he pulled off the not-inconsiderable feat of stealing almost every scene he and Sellers were in--a real accomplishment, considering what a veteran scene-stealer Sellers was. However, Lom did not concentrate solely on feature films. He became a familiar face to British television viewers when he starred as Dr. Roger Corder in . He moved into horror films in the 1970s, with parts in and . He played Prof. Abraham Van Helsing opposite in , matching wits against the sinister vampire himself. Lom appeared as one of the victims in , the drunken Dr. Edward Armstrong. His career continued into the 1980s, a standout role being that of 's sympathetic doctor in . He also played opposite in and returned to the murder mystery , this time playing The General. Lom has been taking it easy since then, though he returned to his familiar role of Dreyfus in . He was always a reliable and eminently watchable actor, and unfortunately did not receive the stardom he should have. Herbert Lom died in his sleep at age 95 on September 27, 2012, in London, England."

    "description": "Hume Cronyn was a Canadian actor with a lengthy career. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in \"The Seventh Cross\" (1944). Cronyn was born to a prominent family. His father was politician Hume Blake Cronyn (1864-1933), Member of Parliament for London, Ontario (term 1917-1921). The elder Cronyn was a grandson of both Benjamin Cronyn, first bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Huron (1802-1871) and politician William Hume Blake (1809-1870), first Chancellor of Upper Canada. Cronyn's mother was Frances Amelia Labatt, heiress of the Labatt Brewing Company. Labatt remains the largest brewing company of Canada. Frances' father was businessman John Labatt (1838-1915), and her grandfather was company founder John Kinder Labatt (1803-1866). The Labatts were a prominent Irish-Canadian family, claiming descent from a French Huguenot family which settled in Ireland. Cronyn was sent to a boarding school in Ottawa, where he studied from 1917 to 1921. The school was at the time called \"Rockliffe Preparatory School\", but has since been renamed to Elmwood School. Elmwood has become a school for girls. Cronyn attended first Ridley College in St. Catharines, and then McGill University in Montreal. During his university years, Cronyn was a featherweight boxer. He was nominated for Canada's Olympic Boxing team for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Cronyn was studying pre-law in the University, but switched his major to acting. He then enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he studied under theatrical director Max Reinhardt (1873-1943). Cronyn made his Broadway debut in 1934, in the play \"Hipper's Holiday\". He had the minor role of a janitor. After a decade as a theatrical actor, Cronyn made his film debut in the psychological thriller \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943). He played crime fiction buff Herbie Hawkins. This was Cronyn's first collaboration with director Alfred Hitchcock. Cronyn later acted in \"Lifeboat\" (1944), and served as a screenwriter for both \"Rope\" (1948) and \"Under Capricorn\" (1949). Cronyn was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Paul Roeder in the concentration camp themed film \"The Seventh Cross\" (1942). Roeder is a common factory worker in Nazi Germany, who risks his life and family to assist his old friend George Heisler (played by Spencer Tracy) to flee the country. While Cronyn's role was well-received, the award was instead won by rival actor Barry Fitzgerald (1888-1961). In 1942, Cronyn married actress Jessica Tandy, and for many years they appeared together in theatre, film and television. The duo headlined the radio series \"The Marriage\" (1953-1954), depicting the difficulties of a professional woman in transitioning to the roles of housewife and mother. The duo also appeared in a television adaptation of the radio series, but it only lasted for 8 episodes. Cronyn acting career mostly included supporting roles, but he found himself in the spotlight for the role of Joe Finley in the science fiction film \"Cocoon\". It became a surprise box office hit, and Cronyn was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actor. The award was instead won by a much younger actor, Michael J. Fox (1961-). Cronyn returned to the role of Joe Finley in the sequel \"Cocoon: The Return\" (1988). While less successful than its predecessor, Cronyn's role was well-received. He was again nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actor, but again lost to a younger actor. The award was won by Tom Hanks (1956-). Jessica Tandy died in 1994, and the widowed Cronyn married writer Susan Cooper in 1996. Cronyn had one of his last prominent roles in the film \"Marvin's Room\" (1996). He played the incapacitated and bed-ridden Marvin Wakefield, who has to be taken care of by his adult daughters. The cast of the film was collectively nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. Cronyn's last film role was the role of con-artist Sam Clausner in the television film \"Off Season\" (2001). Cronyn died in 2003 from prostate cancer. He was 91-years-old."

Raised near Newcastle in England after the family relocated, he initially studied art and worked for some time as an interior designer. However, after seeing a play with at the West End, Stevenson became inspired to study drama at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. By the time of his graduation in 1993, he had already made his debut on the stage at the Barbican Theatre in London in the plays Temptation and Revenger's Tragedy. He made his first recurring screen appearances in the TV crime drama (acting alongside his future wife ) and as DI Tony Baynham in the BBC procedural police series , which was briefly touted as a rival to . Though Stevenson first attracted international attention as a dependable Knight of the Round Table in the motion picture , it was his charismatic performance as the rascally, hedonistic soldier Titus Pullo in HBO's historical series which truly put him on the map. More vigorous or pugnacious warrior roles soon came his way, beginning with a starring turn as the titular anti-hero vigilante Frank Castle in the ultra-violent , for which Stevenson put himself through strenuous martial arts and weapons training under the direction of U.S. Force Reconnaissance (FORECON) Marines. Among his subsequent gallery of colourful characters were the powerful Asgardian warrior Volstagg in Marvel's , , and ; the relentless enforcer Redridge in ; an Irish mobster challenging the Cleveland Mafia for control of the city's criminal underworld in ; Porthos, one of the ; the much feared Blackbeard in Starz's excellent swashbuckling , and the enigmatic Anglo-Saxon missionary and explorer Othere in . Stevenson reserved one of the most compelling performances for the strangely sympathetic Russian gangster Isaak Sirko, chief antagonist in season seven of , overshadowing even that of the star (definitely no mean feat!). Add to that another acting standout as the obsessed, revenge-driven Commander Jack Swinburne in the German-produced World War II drama series . Having first joined the Star Wars universe as a voice actor (the Mandalorian Gar Saxon in ), Stevenson was later cast in the villainous role of dark Force user Baylan Skoll doing battle with the indomitable Tano (), complete with orange/red lightsaber. Stevenson said in a 2020 interview that he had drawn much of his inspiration from veteran tough guys like and : \"Never a bad performance, and brave and fearless within that caliber. It was never the young, hot leading man; it was men who I could identify with.\" Tragically, this supremely accomplished and charismatic actor died in Italy on 21 May 2023 while filming , in which he was cast as a fading movie action hero attempting to revive his career.

    "description": "Distinguished character actor David Hattersley Warner was born on July 29, 1941 in Manchester, England, to Ada Doreen (Hattersley) and Herbert Simon Warner. He was born out of wedlock and raised by each of his parents, eventually settling with his itinerant father and stepmother. He only saw his mother again on her deathbed. As an only child from a dysfunctional family, young David excelled neither at academia nor at athletics. He attended eight schools and \"failed his exams at all of them.\" After a series of odd jobs, he was accepted against all odds at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), and became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. When he first took up acting, it was not with the notion of a prospective career, but rather to escape (in his own words) 'a messy childhood.' Warner received some early mentoring from one of his teachers, and made his theatrical debut in 1962 at the Royal Court Theatre as Snout in A Midsummer Night's Dream, directed by . A year later, he became the youngest-ever actor to play Hamlet at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Comedy may not have been his forte as much as the likes of Falstaff, Lysander and (on several occasions) Henry VI. Eventually becoming disaffected with the theatre (and plagued for some years by stage fright), Warner found himself better served by the celluloid medium. His first big break came on the strength of his small part in A Midsummer Night's Dream, courtesy of Tony Richardson who cast him in his bawdy period romp as the mendacious, pimple-faced antagonist Blifil, who vied with for the affections of . A proper starring turn on the big screen followed in due course with the title role in , Warner playing a deranged artist with Marxist leanings who goes to absurd lengths to reclaim his ex-wife (played by ), including blowing up his mother-in-law. In yet another off-beat satire, , Warner played a corporate drop-out who grows psychedelic mushrooms in an automated world of the future. Combined with his two-year stint as Hamlet with the RSC, Warner became a star at age 24. By the 1970s, he had become one of Britain's most sought-after character actors and went on to enjoy an illustrious and prolific career on both sides of the Atlantic, throughout which he rarely spurned a role offered him. Tall and somewhat ungainly in appearance, Warner excelled at troubled, introspective loners, outcasts and mavericks or downright sinister individuals. The latter have included SS General Reinhardt Heydrich in , Jack the Ripper in , Picard's sadistic Cardassian torturer Gul Madred in , the villainous ex-Pinkerton man Spicer Lovejoy in and the evil geniuses of (a role turned down by ) and . He also essayed the creature to 's . Less eccentric roles saw him as the doomed photojournalist who literally loses his head in (Warner later described the experience of working alongside as a career highlight), the sympathetic, but equally ill-fated Klingon Chancellor Gorkon in and the sad, likeable fantasist Aldous Gajic, searching for the Grail in . Warner also appeared in a trio of films for which he was handpicked by the director . Best of these is arguably the comedy western , with Warner well cast as the roving-eyed, itinerant Reverend Joshua Duncan Sloane. Warner won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series for his performance as the Roman Senator Pomponius Falco in the miniseries . Following a three-decade long absence, Warner returned to the stage in 2001 for the role of Andrew Undershaft in Shaw's Major Barbara. In 2004, he played the title role in King Lear at the Chichester Theatre Festival in England. More recently, he appeared on TV as Professor Abraham Van Helsing in , as Rabbi Max Steiner in and as 's ailing father in . A riveting screen presence, the ever-versatile and charismatic David Warner passed away aged 80 from cancer at Denville Hall, an entertainment industry care home, in Northwood, London, on 24 July 2022."

    "description": "What an amazing career! Few can boast a longer one (64 years of activity). Few have been able to have to relate to three generations. And it is pretty sure that no one can compare with him in terms of faithfulness to a director: Chishu Ryu indeed appeared in no fewer than fifty-two out of fifty-four of his master Yasujirô Ozu. He played in 187 films or TV films and could be a very versatile actor: for instance in 1936, when he was thirty, he embodied a student in one film and an old man in another. However he was perfect in Ozu's films, most often, as a simple, unobtrusive man whose humanity is revealed through the hardships of everyday life. How could Japanese cinema have done without Chishu Ryu?"

    "description": "The zaniest of all madcap comedy teams were the Marx Brothers, namely Groucho (aka Julius Henry), Chico (aka Leonard), and Harpo (aka Adolph). There were also Zeppo (aka Herbert) -- who featured in their early comedies as a straight man and later became a theatrical agent -- and Gummo (aka Milton), who eschewed the entertainment industry for a career in business. Though the Marxes were born in New York, their father Simon (nicknamed 'Frenchie') originally hailed from Germany. He was a clothing cutter, who (according to Groucho) had lofty aspirations of becoming a tailor. He later changed his name to Sam. Their mother came from Alsace-Lorraine and was a noted beauty named Minnie Schoenberg. The brothers were raised in the Jewish faith and grew up in a poor Manhattan neighbourhood of mostly Italian and German immigrants on East 93rd Street. was the first to enter show business as a boy soprano with the show 'Boys and Girls'. His first 'proper job' was on Coney Island, singing a song while sitting on a keg of beer. This earned him a dollar. became a piano salesman at Shapiro and Bernstein. In 1908, Minnie, whose parents had once operated a travelling theatrical troupe, organised Groucho, , and a kid named Lou Levy into a musical act on vaudeville. They became known as the Four Nightingales. With further additions, this expanded into the Six Mascots by 1912. The Marxe's uncle, a well-established German-born comic and vaudevillian named , began to refine the show business personae of the brothers and also contributed to writing their first successful skit. Groucho now started walking with a loping stoop and became verbose. Harpo donned a red wig and became a mute. Chico wore a pointy hat and adopted an Italian accent. Their growing success on the vaudeville circuit led to a sojourn in England in the early 20s where they appeared in a musical revue entitled On the Balcony. In 1924, Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo achieved their first major breakthrough on Broadway in the comedy musical I'll Say She Is. Groucho, playing Napoleon Bonaparte, sported his painted on moustache for the first time on the big stage (the cigar came later). In 1925, the Marxes headlined with their own material in The Cocoanuts which later also became their first talking picture. The brothers (after 1933 minus straight man ) went on to star in another dozen motion pictures. These included , , and (for Paramount) and , (arguably their best), , and (for MGM). By the early 30s, their on- screen characters had become fully-fledged. Few directors could fully contain (or control) them, though some did better than others. Groucho pretty much dominated (and chewed) the scene as the garrulous master of barbed insults and double entendres (he also wrote or co-wrote most of the gags and one-liners). His characters had memorable names like Hugo Z. Hackenbush, J. Cheever Loophole and Rufus T. Firefly. Chico was slow-witted and somewhat shady, playing the piano with his inimitable style during musical interludes. Finally, child-like Harpo, eating plates, drinking ink and chasing girls (and, of course, playing the harp). Matronly , often on the receiving end of Groucho's jokes, remained mostly stoic, never quite 'getting it'. Their uniquely anarchic style of comedy has remained popular to this day, neatly summed up by Fiorello (Chico) pointing out to Otis P. Driftwood (Groucho) in A Day at the Races that in a Marx Brothers contract \"There ain't no Sanity Clause\". ."

    "description": "Harvard-educated stage and screen actor Richard Jordan was born into a socially prominent family on July 19, 1937 in New York City, the grandson of Learned Hand, the greatest American jurist never to have served on the U.S. Supreme Court. Newbold Morris, his stepfather, was a member of the New York City Council during Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia's administration. Young Richard was educated in private Manhattan schools and then at the exclusive Hotchkiss prep school in Lakeville, Connecticut. While at Hotchkiss, he was outstanding as the eponymous lead of the school play \"Mr. Roberts\", which won him a place in the Sharon, Connecticut summer stock company. Jordan went to England as an exchange student at the Sherbourne School, a college (private school) that was over 1,000 years old. After graduating from Sherbourne, Jordan entered Harvard College and took his degree in three years. At Harvard, Jordan was a member of the Dramatic Club, both as an actor and as a director. It was while at Harvard that he decided to become a professional actor and began performing with off-campus stage companies. After graduating from Harvard, Jordan launched what was to be a prolific stage career in New York, making his Broadway debut in December 1961 in the play \"Take Her, She's Mine\" under the direction of the venerable in Biltmore Theatre. The play, which starred , in a Tony Award-winning turn, and , was a hit, playing 404 performances. Jordan next appeared in a one-night flop, in \"Bicycle Ride to Nevada\", which opened and closed on September 24, 1963. He was more lucky with his next play, \"Generation\", a comedy starring that played for 300 performances in the 1965-66 season. He last appeared on Broadway in a success d'estime, 's \"A Patriot for Me\", directed by and starring and , who was making his Broadway debut. By that time, Jordan had established himself as a leading player Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway, which accounted for the majority of his over 100 New York stage appearances. Jordan, as actor and director, was a major force in the development of New York's \"Off-Off-Broadway\" theater that flourished in the 1960s. He was one of the founders of the Gotham Arts Theater, which put on plays in an old funeral parlor on West 43rd Street. Fittingly, the company's first play was about necrophilia. Jordan engaged young New York artists to design the sets, the results of which were not always auspicious. Jordan said of this development, \"With our weirdo plays against their far-out sets...it was total insanity!\" He made a significant breakthrough, career-wise, with his appearance in the anti-war play \"The Trial Of The Catonsville Nine\" in both New York and California. Jordan spent eight years with 's New York Shakespeare Festival. He made his debut with Papp's Shakespeare Festival in 1963, playing \"Romeo\" opposite the \"Juliet\" of , the fellow Papp stock company member who would become his wife, in Papp's Shakespeare in the Park series. The couple married in 1964, and their eight-year marriage produced a daughter, , born in 1964, who would later co-star with her father in the movie . Although he appeared on television during the 1960s, the tall, handsome and talented Jordan did not make his motion picture debut until 1971, when he appeared in a supporting role in 's horse opera , which featured a first-rate cast, including , , and . However, it was his role as the baby-faced, amoral Treasury agent in that made him a known commodity on-screen, while it was the monumental mini-series that made his reputation. His performance as the Irish immigrant \"Joseph Armagh\" brought him an Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe award, and it also brought him his long-time companion, co-star , whom he lived with for many years and by whom he had a son. An actor rather than a star, Jordan played many unsympathetic roles, including that of Nazi in the TV movie . He continued to appear on the stage, Off-Broadway and in stock companies touring the major cities of the U.S., while appearing in films and on TV. Jordan was the manager of the L.A. Actors Theater in Los Angeles during the 1970s, where he produced, directed and wrote his own plays. For the 1983-84 Off-Broadway season, he won an Obie Award for his performance in Czech playwright 's \"A Private View\". He won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for directing Havel's \"Largo Desolato\" at the Taper, Too in 1987. In 1992, Jordan had begun filming when his fatal illness forced him to leave the production. Thus, Jordan's final role was that of \"General Lewis Armistead\" in the film , which was a labor of love for him. He was close friends with , the author of the novel \"The Killer Angels\", which the movie was based upon, and contributed to the screenplay. Jordan's last appearance as an actor was the death of his on-screen character, \"General Armistead\". Richard Jordan died in Los Angeles, California of a brain tumor on August 30, 1993. He was 56 years old."

    "description": "David William Duchovny was born on August 7, 1960, in New York City, New York, USA. His father, Amram Ducovny, was a writer and publicist who was from a family of Jewish immigrants (from Ukraine and Poland), and worked for the American Jewish Committee. His mother, Margaret (Miller), was a Scottish-born school teacher. David has a sister, Laurie, and an older brother, , an award-winning director of commercials, as well as a director of photography. David earned an undergraduate degree from Princeton University, and also attended Yale University, where he undertook a Master's Degree in English Literature. A keen poet and writer, David's work was well recognized by his peers and teachers while he was in attendance at Yale. He was even nominated for a college prize by the Academy of American Poets for his outstanding work within the literary field. While at Yale, he began commuting to New York to study acting and was soon appearing in off-Broadway plays. In 1987, he abandoned his doctoral studies at Yale to pursue acting full time. Like any actor or celebrity, David began his career on the bottom, by acting in numerous commercials in the late-eighties. He crossed over into films with bit parts in low key films such as and . Although these parts were small and somewhat insignificant, it was a start and David was able to get his foot in the door. In 1991, David got offered the role of DEA Dennis Bryson on the acclaimed TV series, . He only appeared in three episodes, but at that early stage, it was his biggest claim to fame yet, as was watched by millions of people worldwide. Needless to say, David's talents as an actor would finally be recognized and he would get the acknowledgment that he so richly deserved. In the early 1990s, he got more bit parts in films, this time, however, the films weren't \"low key\", but hits, such as and the family favorite comedy, . David's role in was small, but it was hard to forget the poor guy who was dragged across the lawn by the giant St. Bernard! A year later, in 1993, David got the lead role in the independent film . The film also starred another up-and-coming young actor, . In , David played a journalist who goes on a cross-country tour of famous murder sites with his girlfriend as research for a book he is writing about serial killers. He takes Pitt's character along to help pay the bills, unaware that Pitt's character is in fact a serial killer himself. Although it did not do much business at the box office, it is still a great film and has become somewhat of a cult favorite among fans. That same year, David was offered the role of FBI Agent Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder on the long-running TV series . The show was a tremendous international success and propelled David (and his co-star ) into super-stardom. His character of Mulder has become somewhat of a pop culture legend and is renowned the world over for his satirical wit and dry sense of humor. Fans loved the fact that he could keep a straight face and still crack and joke in the face of extreme danger. David improvised a lot of his own lines of dialogue while on the show and even penned and directed a few episodes. The series ended in 2002 and still has a strong, dedicated following. To date, David has reprised his role of Fox Mulder in two \"X Files\" feature films: and . During the initial run of , David kept busy and made several films, such as: , alongside actress and the comedy favorite , with , and . He even had a hysterical cameo as a self-obsessed, simple-minded hand model in the comedy-smash . In 2007, after a few years out of the limelight, David struck gold again after landing the plum role of Hank Moody in . The raunchy series follows the life of womanizing writer Hank Moody (Duchovny) as he tries to juggle his career and his relationship with his daughter and his ex-girlfriend. The show has become a hit for its off-the-wall humor and Duchovny's ability to always turn in a brilliant performance. It may have taken a while, but David has worked his way to the top and notched up an impressive resume along the way. We can expect to see a lot more of him in the future."

Tall, burly, round-faced and possessed of a powerful and resonant voice, he was mentored early on in his career by the well-known stage director .

Quayle's reputation as an actor grew steadily, and, in 1936, he appeared on Broadway opposite in 'The Country Wife'. For the next few years, he consolidated his position as a Shakespearean actor. When the Second World War began, he was among the first in his profession to enlist, serving with the Royal Artillery and rising to the rank of major. Some of his wartime experiences, such as coordinating operations with Albanian partisans as part of the secret Special Operations Executive, were destined to be paralleled by his fictional post-war screen exploits as incisive army officers or spies. With the war still fresh in his mind, he subsequently published two novels (respectively in 1945, and in 1947), 'Eight Hours from England' and 'On Such a Night'. In 1946, Quayle also made his debut as a theatrical director with a London production of 'Crime and Punishment'. Between 1948 and 1956, he had a distinguished tenure as director of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, bringing into the company some of the biggest stars of the stage, including and . Though acting in films from 1938, the theatre remained his favorite medium. He played diverse roles with great intensity and professionalism, achieving critical acclaim as Petruchio and Falstaff, Tamburlaine and Galileo (on Broadway) and the original role of Andrew Wyke in 's play 'Sleuth' (played in the first screen version by Olivier). In motion pictures Quayle tended to portray tough, dependable authority figures. He was good value for money as Commodore Harwood in , as the enigmatic Afrikaner captain in and as the stuffy, by-the-book Colonel Harry Brighton, who nonetheless appears to have a degree of admiration for . Due to his classical training, Quayle was often used in historical epics, giving one of his best performances as Cardinal Wolsey in , earning him an Academy Award nomination. His voice was heard as narrator of and on radio in anything from 'The Ballad of Robin Hood' to 's 'The Purloined Letter'. The year prior to receiving his knighthood, Quayle founded the touring Compass Theatre Company, and served as its director until a few months before his death from cancer in October 1989."

    "description": "Robert Donat's pleasant voice and somewhat neutral English accent were carefully honed as a boy because he had a stammer and took elocution lessons starting at age 11 to overcome the impediment. It was not too surprising that freedom from such a vocal embarrassment was encouragement to act. His other handicap, acute asthma, did not deter him. At the age of 16 he began performing Shakespeare and other classic roles in a number of repertory and touring companies throughout Britain. In 1924 he joined Sir Frank Benson's repertory company, and later he was with the Liverpool Repertory Theater. His work was finally noticed by , who gave him a three-year film contract. Three minor films were followed by his role as Katherine Howard's lover, Thomas Culpepper, in the hit . Donat's style of acting, whether comic or dramatic, was usually reserved, with the subtleties of face and voice being his talents to complement the role. A top draw in Britain, he went to Hollywood for , but he did not care for the Hollywood scene--the fishbowl lifestyle of the movie star. \"Cristo\" gave him the opportunity for , but he eventually declined. (With a nod to hindsight, it is hard to think of anyone but a fresh-faced Flynn doing the role.) Although he would have contracts with MGM, Warner Bros. and RKO through the remainder of the 1930s, he begged off many a film role or broke commitments, ostensibly because of health problems, though, along with being finicky about roles, he was also such a conscientious actor that lack of confidence sometimes stymied his forward progress. Hollywood usually had to shoot in England if it wanted him badly enough. And that was not a problem after the box office reception given , the big hit for Alfred Hitchcock. There was a hint of whimsy in Donat's face that worked especially well with the sophisticated comedic elements that crept into several of his dramatic roles. His portrayal of individualist Canadian Richard Hannay--which registered with North Americans both above and below the 49th parallel--in \"Steps\" was the first of such popular characters. Some of Hitch's famous on-the-set practical jokes ensued on the first day of shooting \"Steps.\" The first scene was the escape on the moors from the master spy's henchmen by Donat and handcuffed together. Donat and Carroll had not met before this, and Hitchcock handcuffed them together hours before filming so that they could get very well acquainted. He insisted he had misplaced the key when in fact he had slipped it to a studio security officer for safekeeping. Hitchcock attempted to land Donat for three other roles, and and , but illness, commitments, and more illness, respectively, supposedly kept Donat from accepting each. Hollywood would be treated in kind, for Donat was more dedicated to stage work. Hollywood did get him for , for which he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. He won the Oscar the next year for perhaps his best known role in Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939) (MGM's with ). Since 1939 was one of the most competitive film years in Hollywood history, Donat's reward for his mild Mr. Chipping was something of a stunner. This was the year of , and as Rhett Butler seemed a shoo-in for best actor. But there is something of a myth that since both pictures were from MGM and \"Wind\" had so many nominations (including best actor, actress, and picture), MGM head and strongman Louis B. Mayer used his weight to spread the wealth toward \"Chips\". Unlike other British actors who came to work in America during World War II, Donat stayed in Britain. He did mostly theater but also some British films--only four--with one for Korda and one for Carol Reed. Only six more films were allotted Donat after the war and into the 1950s, all but one British productions. He starred, directed and co-wrote and starred in , a well-crafted and delightful (if a bit fictionalized) salute to the history of the British film industry. By 1955, all of Donat's acting efforts required a bottle of oxygen kept off stage and at the ready as his health continued to turn toward the worse. , a Twentieth Century Fox production shot in the UK, was Donat's final film. His fragility was poignantly obvious on screen, and he died shortly after the film was finished. He received a posthumous Special Citation from the USA National Board of Review and was nominated for a Best Actor Golden Globe. It was a career for Robert Donat that should have gone on, yet it was filled with many notable screen memories just the same."

    "description": "Sir Dirk Bogarde, distinguished film actor and writer, was born Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde on March 28, 1921, to Ulric van den Bogaerde, the art editor of \"The Times\" (London) newspaper, and actress Margaret Niven in the London suburb of Hampstead. He was one of three children, with sister Elizabeth and younger brother Gareth. His father was Flemish and his mother was of Scottish descent. Ulric Bogaerde started the Times' arts department and served as its first art editor. Derek's mother, Margaret - the daughter of actor and painter Forrest Niven - appeared in the play \"Bunty Pulls The Strings\", but she quit the boards in accordance with her husband's wishes. The young Derek Bogaerde was raised at the family home in Sussex by his sister, Elizabeth, and his nanny, . Educated at the Allen Glen's School in Glasgow, he also attended London's University College School before majoring in commercial art at Chelsea Polytechnic, where his teachers included . Though his father wanted his eldest son to follow him into the \"Times\" as an art critic and had groomed him for that role, Derek dropped out of his commercial art course and became a drama student, though his acting talent at that time was unpromising. In the 1930s he went to work as a commercial artist and a scene designer. He apprenticed as an actor with the Amersham Repertory Company, and made his acting debut in 1939 on a small London stage, the Q Theatre, in a role in which he delivered only one line. His debut in London's West End came a few months later in 's play \"Cornelius,\" in which he was billed as \"Derek Bogaerde\". He made his uncredited debut as an extra in the pre-war comedy . The September 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union triggered World War II, and in 1940 Bogarde joined the Queen's Royal Regiment as an officer. He served in the Air Photographic Intelligence Unit and eventually attained the rank of major. Nicknamed \"Pippin\" and \"Pip\" during the war, he was awarded seven medals in his five years of active duty. He wrote poems and painted during the war, and in 1943, a small magazine published one of his poems, \"Steel Cathedrals,\" which subsequently was anthologized. His paintings of the war are part of the Imperial War Museum's collection. Similar to his character, Captain Hargreaves, in , he was called upon to put a wounded soldier out of his misery, a tale recounted in one of his seven volumes of autobiography. While serving with the Air Photographic Intelligence Unit, he took part in the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, which he said was akin to \"looking into Dante's Inferno\". In one of his autobiographies, he wrote, \"At 24, the age I was then, deep shock stays registered forever. An internal tattooing which is removable only by surgery, it cannot be conveniently sponged away by time.\" After being demobilized, he returned to acting. His agent re-christened him \"Dirk Bogarde,\" a name that he would make famous within a decade. In 1947 he appeared in \"Power Without Glory\" at the New Lindsay Theatre, a performance that was praised by , who urged him to continue his acting career. The Rank Organization had signed him to a contract after a talent scout saw him in the play, and he made his credited movie debut in with a one-line bit as a policeman. His first lead in a movie came that year when Wessex Films, distributed by Rank, gave him a part in the proposed film . When Granger dropped out, Bogarde took over the lead. Rank subsequently signed him to a long-term contract and he appeared in a variety of parts during the 14 years he was under contract to the studio. For three years he toiled in Rank movies as an apprentice actor without making much of a ripple; then in 1950, he was given the role of young hood Tom Riley in the crime thriller (the title comes from the blue-colored light on police call-boxes in London), the most successful British film of 1950, which established Bogarde as an actor of note. Playing a cop killer, an unspeakable crime in the England of the time, it was the first of the intense neurotics and attractive villains that Bogarde would often play. He continued to act on-stage, appearing in the West End in 's \"Point of Departure\". While he was praised for his performance, stage acting made him nervous, and as he became more famous, he began to be mobbed by fans. The pressure of the public adulation proved overwhelming, particularly as he suffered from stage fright. He was accosted by crowds of fans at the stage door during the 1955 touring production of \"Summertime,\" and his more enthusiastic admirers even shouted at him during the play. He was to appear in only one more play, the Oxford Playhouse production of \"Jezebel,\" in 1958. He never again took to the boards, despite receiving attractive offers. He first acted for American expatriate director in . Losey, a Communist and self-described Stalinist at the time, had emigrated to England after being blacklisted in Hollywood after he refused to direct at RKO Pictures, which was owned by right-wing multi-millionaire at the time, and he was accused in testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee of being a Communist. The director, like Bogarde, would not find his stride until the early 1960s, and Losey and Bogarde would build their reputations together. First, however, Losey had to overcome Bogarde's reluctance to star in a low-budget film (shot for $300,000) with a blacklisted American director. Losey, who had never heard of Bogarde until he was proposed for the film, met with him and asked Bogarde to view one of his pictures. After seeing the film, Bogarde was enthusiastic, and Losey talked him into taking the role, which he accepted at a reduced fee (Losey originally was not credited with directing the film due to his being blacklisted in the States). A decade later they would make more memorable films that would be watersheds in their careers. It was not drama but comedy that made Dirk Bogarde a star. He achieved the first rank of English movie stardom playing Dr. Simon Sparrow in the comedy . The film was a smash hit, becoming one of the most popular British films in history, with 17 million admissions in its first year of release. As Sparrow, Bogarde became a heartthrob and the most popular British movie star of the mid-50s. He reprised the character in , . The title of the latter film may have described his mood as a serious actor having to do another turn as Dr. Sparrow between his career-making performances in Losey's , with a script by , and Losey's adaptation of the stage play , in which Bogarde memorably played the attorney for a young deserter (played by ). Bogarde, hailed as \"the idol of the Odeons\" in honor of his box-office clout, was offered the role of Jimmy Porter in by producer and director , based on the play that touched off the \"Angry Young Man\" and \"Kitchen Sink School\" of contemporary English drama in the 1950s. Though Bogarde wanted to take the part, Rank refused to let him make the film on the grounds that there was \"altogether too much dialog.\" The part went to instead, who went over-the-top in portraying his very angry, not-so-young man. After this disappointment, Bogarde went to Hollywood to play in and to appear in 's Spanish Civil War drama with . Both were big-budgeted films, but hampered by poor scripts, and after both films failed, Bogarde avoided Hollywood from then on. He was reportedly quite smitten with his French \"Song Without End\" co-star , and wanted to marry her. Capucine, who suffered from bi-polar disorder, was bisexual with an admitted preference for women. The relationship did not lead to marriage, but did result in a long-term friendship. It apparently was his only serious relationship with a woman, though he had many women friends, including his co-star . In the early 1960s, with the expiration of his Rank contract, Bogarde made the decision to abandon his hugely successful career in commercial movies and concentrate on more complex, art house films (at the same time, made a similar decision, though Lancaster continued to alternate his artistic ventures with more crassly commercial endeavors). Bogarde appeared in 's seminal film , the first British movie to sympathetically address the persecution of homosexuals. His career choice alienated many of his old fans, but he was no longer interested in being a commercial movie star; he, like Lancaster, was interested in developing as an actor and artist (however, that sense of finding himself as an actor did not extend to the stage. His reputation was such in 1963 that he was invited by National Theatre director to appear as Hamlet to open the newly built Chichester Festival Theatre. That production of the eponymous play also was intended to open the National Theatre's first season in London. Bogarde declined, and the honor went instead to , who floundered in the part.) Jack Grimston, in Bogarde's \"Sunday Times\" obituary of May 9, 1999, entitled \"Bogarde, a solitary star at the edge of the spotlight,\" said of the late actor that he \"belonged to a group that was rare in the British cinema. He was a fine screen player who owed little to the stage. Dilys Powell, the Sunday Times film critic, wrote of him before her own death: 'Most of our gifted film players really belonged to the theater. Bogarde belonged to the screen.'\" Bogarde had won the London Critics Circle's Dilys Powell award for outstanding contribution to cinema in 1992. Appearing in \"Victim\" was a huge career gamble. In the film, Bogarde played a married barrister who is being blackmailed over his closeted homosexuality. Rather than let the blackmail continue, and allow the perpetrators to victimize other gay men, Bogarde's character effectively sacrifices himself, specifically his marriage and his career, by bravely confessing to be gay (homosexuality was an offence in the United Kingdom until 1967, and there reportedly had been a police crackdown against homosexuals after World War II which made gay men particularly vulnerable to blackmail). The film was not released in mainstream theaters in the US, as the Production Code Administration (PCA) refused to classify the film and most theaters would not show films that did not carry the PCA seal of approval. \"Victim\" was the antithesis of the light comedy of Bogarde's \"Doctor\" movies, and many fans of his character Simon Sparrow were forever alienated by his portrayal of a homosexual. For himself, Bogarde was proud of the film and his participation in it, which many think stimulated public debate over homosexuality. The film undoubtedly raised the public consciousness over the egregious and unjust individual costs of anti-gay bigotry. The public attitude towards the \"love that dared not speak its name\" changed enough so that within six years, the 1967 Sexual Offences Act decriminalizing homosexual acts between adults passed Parliament. Bogarde reported that he received many letters praising him for playing the role. His courage in taking on such a role is even more significant in that he most likely was gay himself, and thus exposed himself to a backlash. Bogarde always publicly denied he was a homosexual, though later in life he did confess that he and his manager, , had a long-term relationship. When Bogarde met him in 1939, Forwood was a theatrical manager, who eventually married and divorced . Forwood became Bogarde's friend and subsequently his life partner, and the two moved to France together in 1968. They bought a 15th-century farmhouse near Grasse in Provence in the early 1970s, which they restored. Bogarde and Forwood lived in the house until 1983, when they returned to London so that Forwood could be treated for cancer, from which he eventually died in 1988. Bogarde nursed him in the last few months of his life. After Forwood died, Bogarde was left rudderless and he became more reclusive, eventually retiring from films after . Mark Rowe and Jeremy Kay, in their obituary of Bogarde, \"Two brilliant lives - on film and in print,\" published in \"The Independent\" on May, 9, 1999, wrote, \"Although he documented with frankness his early sexual encounters with girls and later his adoring love for and , he never wrote about his longest and closest relationship - with his friend and manager for more than 50 years, Tony Forwood. Sir Dirk said the clues to his private life were in his books. \"If you've got your wits about you, you will know who I am.\" The British documentary made with the permission of his family, stressed the fact that he and Forwood were committed lifelong partners. In the same issue, the National Film Theatre's David Thompson, in the article \"The public understood he was essentially gay,\" wrote about Bogarde at his high-water mark in the 1950s, that \"Audiences of that time loved him . . . Very few people picked up on the fact that there was a distinct gay undertone. It says something about British audiences of the time. He had the good fortune to break out of that prison, and it came through the film , where he played a gay character, and through meeting with , who directed him in . For the first time, Bogarde's ambivalence was exploited and used by film.\" Bogarde's sexuality is not the issue; what was striking was that it was an act of personal courage for one of Britian's leading box-office attractions to appear in such a provocative and controversial film. Even in the 21st century, many mainstream actors are afraid to play a gay character lest they engender a public backlash against themselves, which is much less likely than it was more than 40 years ago when Bogarde made \"Victim.\" Apart from sociology, \"Victim\" marks the milestone in which critics and audiences could discern the metamorphosis of Bogarde into the mature actor who went on to become one of the cinema's finest performers. Most of Bogarde's best and most serious roles come after \"Victim,\" the film in which he first stretched himself and broke out of the mold of \"movie star.\" He received the first of his six nominations as Best Actor from the British Academy of Film & Television Arts (BAFTA) for the film. Bogarde co-starred with in , and with in (a.k.a. \"Damn the Defiant!\"). In 1963 he reunited with Losey to film the first of two Losey films with screenplays by Pinter. Bogarde's participation in the two Losey/Pinter collaborations, and , in addition to 1964's \"King & Country\", solidified his reputation. Critics and savvy moviegoers appreciated the fact that Bogarde had developed into a first-rate actor. For his role as the eponymous servant, Bogarde won BAFTA's Best Actor Award. He had now \"officially\" arrived in the inner circle of the best British film actors. These three films also elevated Losey into the ranks of major directors (Bogarde also starred in Losey's 1966 spy spoof , but that film did little to enhance either man's reputation. He turned down the opportunity to appear in Losey's due to the poor quality of the script). Philip French, in his obituary \"Dark, exotic and yet essentially English\", published in \"The Observer\" on May 9, 1999, said of Bogarde, \"Losey discovered something more complex and sinister in his English persona and his performance as Barrett, the malevolent valet in 'The Servant,' scripted by Harold Pinter, is possibly the most subtle, revealing thing he ever did - by confronting his homosexuality in a non-gay context.\" Losey told interviewer Michel Ciment that his work with Bogarde represented a turning point in the actor's career, when he developed into an actor of depth and power. He also frankly admitted to Ciment that without Bogarde, his career would have stagnated and never reached the heights of success and critical acclaim that it did in the 1960s. Interestingly during the filming of \"The Servant.\" Losey was hospitalized with pneumonia. He asked Bogarde to direct the film in order to keep shooting so that the producers would not cancel the film. A reluctant Bogarde complied with Losey's wishes and directed for ten days. He later said that he would never direct again. Bogarde co-starred with up-and-coming actress in 's , for which Christie won a Best Actress Oscar and was vaulted into 1960s cinema superstardom. During the filming of the movie, both Bogarde and Christie were waiting to hear whether they would be cast as Yuri Zhivago and his lover Lara in 's upcoming blockbuster . Christie got the call, Bogarde didn't, but he was well along in the process of establishing himself as one of the screen's best and most important actors. He won his second BAFTA Best Actor Award for his performance in \"Darling.\" Bogarde went on to major starring roles in such important pictures as , for which won a Best Actor Academy Award nomination. While Bogarde never was nominated for an Oscar, he had the honor of starring in two films for , (\"The Damned\") and , based on 's novella \"Death in Venice.\" Bogarde felt that his performance as Gustav von Aschenbach, the dying composer in love with a young boy and with the concept of beauty, in \"Death in Venice\" was the \"the peak and end of my career . . . I can never hope to give a better performance in a better film.\" Visconti told Bogarde that when the lights went up in a Los Angeles screening room after a showing of \"Death in Venice\" for American studio executives, no one said anything. The silence encouraged Visconti, who believed it meant that the executives were undergoing a catharsis after watching his masterpiece. However, he soon realized that, in Bogarde's own words, \"Apparently they were stunned into horrified silence . . . A group of slumped nylon-suited men stared dully at the blank screen.\" One nervous executive, feeling something should be said, got up and asked, \"Signore Visconti, who was responsible for the score of the film?\" \",\" Visconti replied. \"Just great!\", said the nervous man. \"I think we should sign him.\" After \"Venice\", Bogarde made only seven films over the next two decades and was scathing about the quality of the scripts he was offered. To express himself artistically, he began to write. In his third volumes of autobiography, he wrote, \"No longer do the great Jewish dynasties hold power: the people who were, when all is said and done, the Picture People. Now the cinema is controlled by vast firms like Xerox, Gulf & Western, and many others who deal in anything from sanitary-ware to property development. These huge conglomerates, faceless, soulless, are concerned only with making a profit; never a work of art . . . \" He rued the fact that \"it is pointless to be 'superb' in a commercial failure; and most of the films which I had deliberately chosen to make in the last few years were, by and large, just that. Or so I am always informed by the businessmen. The critics may have liked them extravagantly, but the distributors shy away from what they term 'A Critic's Film', for it often means that the public will stay away. Which, in the mass, they do: and if you don't make money at the box-office you are not asked back to play again.\" However, the courageous artist was not to be daunted: \"But I'd had very good innings. Better than most. So what the hell?\" His well-written works were enthusiastically received by critics and the book-buying public. Bogarde appeared in another film that flirted with the theme of German fascism, 's highly controversial (\"The Night Porter\"). He played an ex-SS officer who encounters a woman with whom he had been engaged in a sado-masochistic affair at a World War II Nazi extermination camp. Many critics found the film, which featured extensive nudity courtesy of , crassly offensive, but no one faulted Bogarde's performance. He played Lt. Gen. Frederick \"Boy\" Browning in the all-star blockbuster . Although some of his fellow actors were World War II veterans, only Bogarde had been involved in the actual battle. His performance arguably is the best in the film. Appearing in ' art house hit gave Bogarde the opportunity to co-star with . He also starred in German wunderkind 's adaptation of 's , with a script by . Though the film was not much of a critical success, Bogarde's acting as 1930s German businessman Hermann Hermann, a man who chooses to go mad when faced with the paradoxes of his life in his proto-fascist fatherland, was highly praised. Bogarde enjoyed working with Fassbinder. He wrote that \"Rainer's work was extraordinarily similar to that of Visconti's; despite their age difference, they both behaved, on set, in much the same manner. Both had an incredible knowledge of the camera: the first essential. Both knew how it could be made to function; they had the same feeling for movement on the screen, of the all-important (and often-neglected) 'pacing' of a film, from start to finish, of composition, of texture, and probably most of all they shared that strange ability to explore and probe into the very depths of the character which one had offered them.\" After his experience with Fassbinder, he acted only four more times, twice in feature films and twice on television. Bogarde was nominated for a Golden Globe for playing in . He got rave reviews playing 's father in 's , his last film. In 1984 Bogarde was asked to serve as president of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival, a huge honor for the actor, as he was the first Briton ever to serve in that capacity. Two years earlier he had been made a Chevalier de l'Ordre des lettres 1982. A decade later, he was knighted by on February 13, 1992. Bogarde won two Best Actor Awards out of six nominations from the British Academy of Film & Television Arts, for \"The Servant\" and \"Darling\" in 1964 and 1966, respectively. He was also nominated in 1962 for \"Victim,\" in 1968 for \"Accident\" and and in 1972 for \"Morte a Venezia.\" Bogarde suffered a stroke in 1996, and though it rendered him partially paralyzed, he was able to recover and live in his own flat in Chelsea. However, by May of 1998 he required around-the-clock nursing care, and he had his lawyers draw up a \"living will,\" also known as a no-resuscitation order. Bogarde publicly came out in favor of voluntary euthanasia, becoming Vice President of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society. He publicly addressed the subject of his own \"living will,\" which ordered that no extraordinary measures be taken to keep him alive should he become terminally ill. The living will proved unnecessary. Dirk Bogarde died of a heart attack on May 8, 1999, in his home in Chelsea, London, England. According to his nephew Brock Van den Bogaerde, the family planned to hold a private funeral but no memorial service in accordance with his uncle's wish \"just to forget me.\" Bogarde wanted to be cremated and have his ashes scattered in France, and accordingly, his remains were returned to Provence. Margaret Hinxman, in her May 10, 1999, obituary in \"The Guardian\", said of him, \"At his peak and with directors he trusted - Joseph Losey, Luchino Visconti and Alain Resnais - Dirk Bogarde . . . was probably the finest, most complete, actor on the screen.\" Clive Fisher's obituary in \"The Independent\" on May 10, 1999, praised Bogarde as \"a major figure because, wherever they were made, his finest films are all somehow about him. He was a great self-portraitist and the screen persona he fashioned, a stylization of his private being, not only dominated its surroundings but spoke subliminally and powerfully to British audiences about the tensions of the time, about connivances and cruel respectabilities of England in the Fifties and Sixties.\" The secret of Dirk Bogarde's success as a great cinema actor was his intimate relationship with the camera. Bogarde believed that the key to acting on film was the eyes, specifically, the \"look\" of the actor. Like , it didn't matter if an actor was good with line readings if they had mastery over the \"look.\" For many critics and movie-goers at the end of the 20th century, Dirk Bogarde's face epitomized the \"look\" of Britain in the tumultuous decades after the Second World War. David Tindle's portrait of Bogarde is part of the collection of London's National Portrait Gallery, London. In 1999, the portrait, on temporary loan, was displayed at 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence, with other modern works of art. Officially, Dirk Bogarde had become the look of Britain."

He was the youngest of four children. During WWI, he volunteered and was commissioned as an infantry lieutenant, and was wounded three times. A distinguished stage actor in his native Hungary, Austria-Hungary, he began his stage career in 1901 and started appearing in films during World War I, fleeing to Germany in 1919 as a result of his left-wing political activity (he organized an actors' union). In 1920 he emigrated to the US and made a living as a character actor, shooting to fame when he played Count Dracula in the legendary 1927 Broadway stage adaptation of 's novel. It ran for three years, and was subsequently, and memorably, filmed by in 1931, establishing Lugosi as one of the screen's greatest personifications of pure evil. Also in 1931, he became a U.S. citizen. Sadly, his reputation rapidly declined, mainly because he had been blacklisted by the main studios and had no choice but to accept any part (and script) handed to him, and ended up playing parodies of his greatest role, in low-grade poverty row films. Due to shady blacklisting among the top Hollywood studio executives, he refused to sell out or to compromise his integrity, and therefore ended his career working for the legendary Worst Director of All Time, . Lugosi was married to Ilona Szmik (1917 - 1920), Ilona von Montagh (? - ?), and Lillian Arch (1933 - 1951). He is the father of Bela Lugosi Jr. (1938). Lugosi helped organize the Screen Actors Guild in the mid-'30s, joining as member number 28. Bela Lugosi died of a heart attack August 16, 1956. He was buried in a Dracula costume, including a cape, but not the ones used in the 1931 film, contrary to popular--but unfounded--rumors."

Left home, moved to New York City in 1978, and began playing in the experimental musical group, Gray, with artist Jean Michel Basquiat. After leaving Gray, he formed the band, Bohack, and recorded the highly regarded avant-garde industrial noise album, \"It Took Several Wives\". During the same period, Gallo also became known in New York City for his very unusual street performances, which were spontaneously executed in public and also witnessed by invited guests in the know. The One-Armed Man, The Man with No Face, Sandman, Boy Hit by a Car, and Boy Cries in Restaurant Window, to name a few. These radical public performances were upsetting and disturbing and were meant to provoke thought, self-reflection and consciousness. Gallo's invited guests could witness his performance's impact in this larger public context. One invited guest, New York Underground filmmaker, , cast Gallo as the lead in his film, , alongside newcomer . was Gallo's first appearance in a feature-length film, though previously he had directed himself in several short films, including , and Rocky 10, as well as the collaborations with filmmaker , Vincent Gallo as \"Jesus Christ\" (used in 's ) and Vampire LeStat. Since his early performance art days, Gallo has continued to create very conceptual performance pieces. Examples are a series of protesting of protests. Gallo has also created his own website, which upon closer examination, is actually a highly conceptual artwork resonating with his early performance work. On his website www.vincentgallo.com in the merchandise section, Gallo is selling his sperm and sexual fantasies as conceptual works. Gallo's Internet art questions celebrity, procreation, ego, social agenda, and views of religion, race and sexuality. These public offerings are motivated by extreme sensitivity, concept and thoughtfulness, however their presentation appears crude and offensive. Misinterpretation of this work is common and Gallo is often incorrectly categorized as a racist, sexist, homophobe. Gallo has had over 25 one-man shows of his paintings, including several with famed New York art dealer, Annina Nosei, and 4 museum shows including one at the Hara Museum in Tokyo, Japan. Gallo has also released several musical albums including 2 on the prestigious Warp Records label-When and Recordings of Music for Film. Gallo wrote, composed and performed the original music for the films , The Agent (1990) and . In the 1980s, Gallo reached the professional level of Grand Prix motorcycle racing, though he did not win a national championship. Gallo is one of the actual motorcycle riders in his feature film, . For many years, Gallo has been known and highly respected in hi-fi and music recording circles and is considered by many professionals in the field as having world-class knowledge and experience. He has been published many times by specialty magazines focused on high fidelity designs and equipment as well as music recording techniques and equipment. His collection of vintage hi-fi and recording gear, as well as musical instruments, is amongst the largest and most refined in the world. Gallo is also a fanatic record collector, owning over 35,000 vinyl LP's. Gallo has no agent, manager, assistant or intern and he makes his films without producers, and with extremely scaled down crews. He has self-distributed his movies and is directly involved in his films' sales for distribution. Gallo has also created all of his films' trailers and posters. Gallo is one of the most misunderstood, misquoted, misrepresented talents in the past 25 years and a brief review of his IMDb page suggests he has also been incredibly prolific."

Information is sketchy, however the positions of police constable, sanitation engineer, treasure hunter, sheep castrator, ship-master for hire, fisherman, and soldier seem to be among his more reputable career choices.

Serious roles eluded him, and as his lifestyle eroded his youthful good looks, his career declined. Trouble with lawsuits and the IRS plagued him at this time, eroding what little money he had saved. A few good roles did come his way late in life, however, these were usually that of aging alcoholic, almost mirror images of Flynn.

    "description": "Basil Rathbone was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1892, but three years later his family was forced to flee the country because his father was accused by the Boers of being a British spy at a time when Dutch-British conflicts were leading to the Boer War. The Rathbones escaped to England, where Basil and his two younger siblings, Beatrice and John, were raised. Their mother, Anna Barbara (George), was a violinist, who was born in Grahamstown, South Africa, of British parents, and their father, Edgar Philip Rathbone, was a mining engineer born in Liverpool. From 1906 to 1910 Rathbone attended Repton School, where he was more interested in sports--especially fencing, at which he excelled--than studies, but where he also discovered his interest in the theater. After graduation he planned to pursue acting as a profession, but his father disapproved and suggested that his son try working in business for a year, hoping he would forget about acting. Rathbone accepted his father's suggestion and worked as a clerk for an insurance company--for exactly one year. Then he contacted his cousin Frank Benson, an actor managing a Shakespearean troupe in Stratford-on-Avon. Rathbone was hired as an actor on the condition that he work his way through the ranks, which he did quite rapidly. Starting in bit parts in 1911, he was playing juvenile leads within two years. In 1915 his career was interrupted by the First World War. During his military service, as a second lieutenant in the Liverpool Scottish 2nd Battalion, he worked in intelligence and received the Military Cross for bravery. In 1919, released from military service, he returned to Stratford-on-Avon and continued with Shakespeare but after a year moved onto the London stage. The year after that he made his first appearance on Broadway and his film debut in the silent . For the remainder of the decade Rathbone alternated between the London and New York stages and occasional appearances in films. In 1929 he co-wrote and starred as the title character in a short-running Broadway play called \"Judas\". Soon afterwards he abandoned his first love, the theater, for a film career. During the 1920s his roles had evolved from the romantic lead to the suave lady-killer to the sinister villain (usually wielding a sword), and Hollywood put him to good use during the 1930s in numerous costume romps, including , , , , , , , and others. Rathbone earned two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor as Tybalt in and as King Louis XI in . However, it was in 1939 that Rathbone played his best-known and most popular character, Sherlock Holmes, with as Dr. Watson, first in and then in , which were followed by 12 more films and numerous radio broadcasts over the next seven years. Feeling that his identification with the character was killing his film career, Rathbone went back to New York and the stage in 1946. The next year he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Dr. Sloper in the Broadway play \"The Heiress,\" but afterwards found little rewarding stage work. Nevertheless, during the last two decades of his life, Rathbone was a very busy actor, appearing on numerous television shows, primarily drama, variety and game shows; in occasional films, such as , , and ; and in his own one-man show, \"An Evening with Basil Rathbone\", with which he toured the U.S."

His father was of French and Corsican Italian descent, and his mother was of French and German ancestry. His parents divorced early on, and Delon had a stormy childhood, being frequently expelled from school. In 1953/1954 he served with the French Marines in Indochina. In the mid-'50s he worked at various odd jobs including waiter, salesman and porter in Les Halles market. He decided to try an acting career and in 1957 made his film debut in 's .

Delon was a sensation early in his career; he came to embody the young, energetic, often morally corrupted man. With his breathtaking good looks he was also destined to play tender lovers and romantic heroes, and he was a French embodiment of the type created in America by . His first outstanding success came with the role of the parasite Tom Ripley in 'Rene Clement''s sun-drenched thriller . Delon presented a psychological portrait of a murderous young cynic who attempts to take on the identity of his victim. A totally different role was offered to him by Visconti in . In this film Delon plays the devoted Rocco, who accepts the greatest sacrifices to save his shiftless brother Simon. After several other films in Italy, Delon returned to the criminal genre with in . This work, a classic example of the genre, was distinguished not only by a soundly worked-out screenplay, but also by the careful production and the excellent performances of both Delon and Gabin. It was only in the late 1960s that the sleek and lethal Delon came to epitomize the calm, psychopathic hoodlum, staring into the camera like a cat assessing a mouse.

    "description": "Actor, raconteur, art collector and connoisseur of haute cuisine are just some of the attributes associated with Vincent Price. He was born Vincent Leonard Price, Jr. in St. Louis, Missouri, to Marguerite Cobb \"Daisy\" (Wilcox) and Vincent Leonard Price, who was President of the National Candy Company. His grandfather, also named Vincent, invented Dr. Price's Baking Powder, which was tartar-based. His family was prosperous, as he said, \"not rich enough to evoke envy but successful enough to demand respect.\" His uniquely cultivated voice and persona were the result of a well-rounded education which began when his family dispatched him on a tour of Europe's cultural centers. His secondary education eventually culminated in a B.A. in English from Yale University and a degree in art history from London's Courtauld Institute. Famously, his name has long been a byword for Gothic horror on screen. However, Vincent Price was, first and foremost, a man of the stage. It is where he began his career and where it ended. He faced the footlights for the first time at the Gate Theatre in London. At the age of 23, he played Prince Albert in the premiere of 's 'Victoria Regina' and made such an impression on producer that he launched the play on Broadway that same year (legendary actress played the title role). In early 1938, he was invited to join 's Mercury Theatre on a five-play contract, beginning with 'The Shoemaker's Holiday.' He gave what was described as \"a polished performance.\" Thus established, Vincent continued to make sporadic forays to the Great White Way, including as the Duke of Buckingham in Shakespeare's 'Richard III' (in which a reviewer for the New Yorker found him to be \"satisfactorily detestable\") and as in his award-winning one man show 'Diversions and Delights,' which he took on a hugely successful world-wide tour in 1978. While based in California, Vincent was instrumental in the success of the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, starring in several of their bigger productions, including 'Billy Budd' and 'The Winslow Boy.' In 1952, Vincent joined the national touring company of 'Don Juan in Hell' in which he was cast as the devil. Acting under the direction of and accompanied by noted thespians , and , he later recalled this as one of his \"greatest theatrical excitements.\" As well as acting on stage, Vincent regularly performed on radio network programs, including Lux Radio Theatre, CBS Playhouse and shows for the BBC. He narrated or hosted assorted programs ranging from history (If these Walls Could Speak) to cuisine (Cooking Price-Wise). He wrote several best-selling books on his favorite subjects: art collecting and cookery. In 1962, he was approached by Sears Roebuck to act as a buying consultant \"selling quality pictures to department store customers.\" As if that were not enough, he lectured for 15 years on art, poetry and even the history of villainy. He recorded numerous readings of poems by (nobody ever gave a better recital of \"The Raven\"!), Shelley and Whitman. He also served on the Arts Council of UCLA, was a member of the Fine Arts Committee for the White House, a former chairman of the Indian Arts & Crafts Board and on the board of trustees of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. And besides all of that, Vincent Price remained a much sought-after motion picture actor. He made his first appearance on screen as a romantic lead in , a frothy Universal comedy which came and went without much fanfare. After that, he reprized his stage role as Master Hammon in an early television production of 'The Shoemaker's Holiday.' For one reason or another, Vincent was henceforth typecast as either historical figures (Sir Walter Raleigh, Duke of Clarence, Mormon leader Joseph Smith, King Charles II, Cardinal Richelieu, Omar Khayyam) or ineffectual charmers and gigolos. Under contract to 20th Century Fox (1940-46), provided one of his better vehicles in the latter department, as did the lush Technicolor melodrama which had Vincent showcased in a notably powerful scene as a prosecuting attorney. His performance was singled out by the L.A. Times as meriting \"attention as contending for Academy supporting honors.\" His first fling with the horror genre was , a Gothic melodrama set in the Hudson Valley in the early 1800's. For the first time, Vincent played a part he actually coveted and fought hard to win. His character was in effect a precursor of those he would later make his own while working for and American-International. As demented, drug-addicted landowner Nicholas Van Ryn, he so effectively terrorized 's Miranda Wells that the influential columnist wrote with rare praise: \"The role of Van Ryn calls for a lot of acting and Vincent admits he's a ham and loves to act all over the place, but the fact that he has restrained himself and doesn't over-emote is a tribute to his ability.\" If Vincent was an occasional ham, he proved it with his Harry Lime pastiche Carwood in . Much better was his starring role in a minor western, , in which he was convincingly cast as a larcenous land office clerk attempting to create his own desert baronetcy. With , Vincent fine-tuned the character type he had established in Dragonwyck, adding both pathos and comic elements to the role of the maniacal sculptor Henry Jarrod. It was arduous work under heavy make-up which simulated hideous facial scarring and required three hours to apply and three hours to remove. He later commented that it \"took his face months to heal because it was raw from peeling off wax each night.\" However, the picture proved a sound money maker for Warner Brothers and firmly established Vincent Price in a cult genre from which he was henceforth unable to escape. The majority of his subsequent films were decidedly low-budget affairs in which the star tended to be the sole mitigating factor: , (and its sequel), , the absurd (easily the worst of the bunch) and . With few exceptions, Vincent's acting range would rarely be stretched in the years to come. Vincent's association with the genial Roger Corman began when he received a script for The Fall of the House of Usher, beginning a projected cycle of cost-effective films based on short stories by Edgar Allen Poe. As Roderick Usher, Vincent was Corman's \"first and only choice.\" Though he was to receive a salary of $50,000 for the picture, it was his chance \"to express the psychology of Poe's characters\" and to \"imbue the movie versions with the spirit of Poe\" that clinched the deal for Vincent. He made another six films in this vein, all of them box office winners. Not Academy Award stuff, but nonetheless hugely enjoyable camp entertainment and popular with all but highbrow audiences. Who could forget Vincent at his scenery chewing best as the resurgent inquisitor, luring into the crypt in ? Or as pompous wine aficionado Fortunato Luchresi in that deliriously funny wine tasting competition with Montresor Herringbone () in ? Best still, the climactic battle of the magicians pitting Vincent's Erasmus Craven against 's malevolent Dr. Scarabus in (arguably, the best offering in the Poe cycle). was played strictly for laughs, with the inimitable combo of Price and Lorre this time appearing as homicidal undertakers. For the rest of the 60s, Vincent was content to remain in his niche, playing variations on the same theme in and (as Matthew Hopkins). He also spoofed his screen personae as Dr. Goldfoot and as perennial villain Egghead in the series. He rose once more to the occasion in the cult black comedy (and its sequel ) commenting that he had to play Anton Phibes \"very seriously so that it would come out funny.\" The tagline, a parody of the ad for , announced \"love means never having to say you're ugly.\" During the 70s and 80s, Vincent restricted himself mainly to voice-overs and TV guest appearances. He turned in a playful performance as an insane Shakespearean ham in . His final role of note was as the inventor in , a role written specifically for him. The embodiment of gleeful, suave screen villainy, Vincent Price died in Los Angeles in October 1993 at the age of 82. People magazine eulogized him as \"the Gable of Gothic.\" Much earlier, an English critic named Gilbert Adair spoke for many fans when he said \"Every man his Price - and mine is Vincent.\""

    "description": "This suave, elegant character star was a ubiquitous presence in French cinema for nearly seven decades. His distinguished career extended to both stage and screen and his versatility was such that he could take on just about any persona (in his own words: \"I do not put on an act... I slip away behind my characters\"), from police inspectors to gangsters, from priests and academics to King Louis XVI and the Marquis de Sade. More than a few of his portrayals were of ordinary bourgeois caught up in difficult circumstances or undergoing mid-life crisis. However, Piccoli truly excelled in sardonic, cynical or morally ambiguous roles - playing smooth, quietly-spoken types harbouring dark passions or sinister secrets. His directors have included a veritable who's who of European film makers: (six times), (five times), (who cast him as Jacques Granville, the principal antagonist in ), , , , and . Piccoli was born in Paris on December 27 1925. His parents were both musicians: his father a Swiss-born violinist, his mother a French pianist. He made his screen debut at 19, for a number of years confined to small supporting roles. Becoming actively involved in left-wing politics, Piccoli joined the Saint-Germain-des-Prés social set, headquartered at the Tabou club and comprising intellectuals and artists whose adherents included the philosophers and , as well as the chanson and cabaret singer (to whom Piccoli was married from 1966 to 1976). His career took off in the early 60s and he enjoyed his first major success as 's husband in Godard's . Luis Bunuel also recognized Piccoli's potential and employed his trademark cerebral eloquence on pivotal parts in important films like , and . In 1973, Piccoli formed his own production company, Films 66, which allowed him even greater freedom in selecting his roles. He continued to work steadily, retaining his huge popularity with French audiences throughout the 80s and 90s. Though nominated four times, he never won the coveted Cesar Award. However, his many other accolades included a win as best actor at Cannes in 1980 and two German Film Awards (in 1988 and 1992). He also directed three feature films, one of which, , won the Bastone Bianco critical award at the Venice Film Festival."

    "description": "One of France's most popular actors, writers, and producers, Thierry Lhermitte has been appearing in films since the 1970s. Perhaps best known for work in farcical comedies, the tall, handsome actor has appeared in some of France's more outrageous films over the course of his prolific career. Lhermitte was born on November 24, 1952 in Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine, France, to Rossanne (Bouchara) and André Lhermitte. His mother was from a Sephardi-Ashkenazi Jewish family, and his father was of French background. He began his career as one of the founding members of the comedy troupe Le Splendid. Among the troupe's other founders were Patrice Leconte, Josiane Balasko, and Michel Blanc, all of whom Lhermitte would collaborate with on future films. After his film debut in Bertrand Blier's Les Valseuses (1974) and a supporting role in Bertrand Tavernier's Que La Fête Commence... (1975), Lhermitte had his first screen collaboration with his Le Splendid colleagues, co-writing and acting in Leconte's Les Bronzés (1978). A farcical satire about a group of French tourists vacationing in Africa, the film proved to be phenomenally popular in France, inspiring a sequel the next year and a dedicated cult following. Lhermitte subsequently made his mark starring in a number of comedies, including Les Hommes Preferent les Grosses (1981) with Balasko, Jean-Loup Hubert's L'Année Prochaine...Si Tout Va Bien (1981) with Isabelle Adjani, and Blier's La Femme De Mon Pote (1983). He maintained a prolific work schedule throughout the '80s and '90s, continuing to play the romantic lead in comedies of every possible variety for a diverse array of directors. Lhermitte also continued to collaborate with his Le Splendid colleagues, starring in Leconte's 1993 Tango as a man intent on murdering his wife after she leaves him, and alongside Balasko in Grosse Fatigue, a comedy that featured Michel Blanc both directing and acting in a double role. In 1998, Lhermitte had one of his greatest successes to date as one of the stars of Francis Veber's Le Dîner de Cons. A witty comedy of manners, it featured the actor in top form as an arrogant publisher put in his place by the seemingly moronic man (Jacques Villeret) he has invited to his weekly dinner of idiots. One of the most popular films to be released in France in years, it was a phenomenal hit with critics and audiences alike. In addition to acting, Lhermitte has continued to work as a screenwriter and producer. In 1994, he wrote, produced, and starred in the children's comedy Un Indien dans la Ville; three years later he served as the associate producer for its American remake, Jungle 2 Jungle. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi Children: Victor Lhermitte, Louise Lhermitte, Astree Lhermitte-Soka Father: Andre Lhermitte"

Educated at Caterham School, his first stage role was in elementary school at age 13 playing a Roman noblewoman(!) After gaining experience in amateur theatre groups and following a short stint with a folk singing group, he suddenly left for military service at age 18, serving with a parachute regiment. Following military duty, Jon returned to acting and delved seriously into classical theatre with several different Shakespeare/repertory companies, appearing in over 50-60 plays, including \"Night of the Iguana\" and \"She Stoops to Conquer,\" while also serving as stage manager and/or assistant director for several of these companies. Jon made his on-camera debut on TV in 1964 with guest parts on such British series as the daytime soap \"Crossroads,\" \"The Fellows,\" \"Tom Grattan's War,\" \"Z Cars\" and the part of Sir Edward Mortimer in the BBC-TV play \"Mary, Queen of Scots.\" This culminated in a leading role in the sci-fi British series . A few years later he broke into films with supporting roles in the Hammer Studio horror classics and . This was a rather intense, dramatic sign as to the direction his cinematic career would take. Jon's gloomy, Gothic-edged film career peaked in the early 70s with such classy fare as 's , in which he played the tormented title role, in a particularly gory and controversial presentation; as cuckold husband William Lamb in the historical romancer opposite ; in 's macabre serial-killer thriller , in which he is a suspect in the dastardly crimes; in , an end-of-the-world sci-fi adventure that has since earned cult status; and in the all-star production of , an elegant whodunnit, courtesy of . More importantly, he took part in several Shakespearean pieces that were transferred to TV -- , , and . He also took on another TV series as the title Australian bushranger After filming the Spanish historical drama written and directed by and the Swedish/Spanish co-production of written by the notorious filmmaker , the upcoming 1980's decade would promise more erratic and erotic filming in international drama. Another Spanish-made co-starring role came his way with (Gary Cooper, Who Art in Heaven) written and directed by , followed by the German drama ; a brief return to English soil to co-star with in the political drama ; a pair of German psychological dramas and ; the Israeli political thriller ; and the steamy Italian film (Most Beautiful in the Kingdom) opposite sensuous American model-turned-European film actress . A gentleman with infinite class, intelligence and charm, Jon's pronounced aversion to publicity and preference for privacy kept him from achieving major stardom. Finch turned more and more to British TV work as the years wore on. He appeared as an apparition of Christ in three episodes of the sci-fi mini-series ; portrayed the apostle Luke in the biblical drama ; played Uncle Tom in the small screen version of 's ; appeared as the antagonist King Vortigern in the King Arthur story ; played Count Sylvius in the mini-series ; and headed up the cast in the TV-movie murder mystery . On film, he starred in the horror opus , filmed in Romania, and co-starred in the Philippine-made horror . Jon made his last large screen appearance in the adventure about the Crusades, . Finch was interested in race car driving in the early 1970's but could not obtain a race car license after being diagnosed with diabetes. He was briefly married (1980-1987) to actress and they had one child. They co-starred together in the Spanish-made film drama . He died on December 28, 2012 at age 70 in Sussex, England."

    "description": "British actor Nigel Terry primarily dedicated himself to the classical stage. When he extended himself into film and TV outings, it was mostly for historical or period roles. Over the years, he grew quite comfortable in both a pair of hose and a suit of armor. Terry was born Peter Nigel Terry on August 15, 1945, in Bristol, England, to Doreen Beatrice (Such) and Frank Albert Terry, an RAF pilot. He trained with several repertory companies, including the Oxford Meadow Players and Bristol Old Vic, where some of his better-known works included \"Volpone\", \"Right You Are\", \"The Balcony\", \"Richard II\" and \"Two Gentlemen from Verona\". Over time, he appeared extensively with the Royal Shakespearean Company, the Round House Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre. Showing flashes of brilliance in his film debut as the drooling, moronic and cowardly \"Prince John\" in , Nigel held his own opposite a most intimidating cast that included , Oscar-winner and (who also made his film debut). Surprisingly, it did not lead to a torrent of film roles. In demand on the repertory stage, however, he continued with sterling roles in \"She Stoops to Conquer\", \"'Tis Pity She's a Whore\", \"Queen Christina\", \"Look Out...Here Comes Trouble\", \"The Suicide\" and \"A Month in the Country\". Thirteen years later, Nigel finally returned to the cinema, making a memorable comeback in 's medieval epic as \"King Arthur\", who grew from a humbling, bumbling squire to a noble and rather melancholy ruler throughout the course of the film. This feat, in turn, ignited more on-camera work. Nigel earned kudos playing the title role in 's and, subsequently, turned in other interestingly off-kilter characters for Jarman in , , and , an association that ended with Jarman's AIDS-related death in 1994. Nigel also became a familiar face on British TV. He was probably best-known in America for starring in the US/British series , in which he played \"Sir Thomas Gray\", a medieval knight. In addition, he created fascinating character portraits in the plush TV costumers , and . In the 2000s, Nigel also appeared in the films , and the epic . Nigel Terry died on 30 April, 2015."

    "description": "There are very few character actors from the 1930s, '40s or '50s who rose to the rank of stardom. Only a rare man or woman reached the level of renown and admiration, and had enough audience appeal, to be the first name in a cast's billing, a name that got marquee posting. Charles Coburn comes to mind, but there aren't many others. However, one who made it was Edmund Gwenn. Gwenn was born Edmund Kellaway in Wandsworth, London, on September 26, 1877. He was the oldest boy in the family, which at that time meant he was the only one who really mattered. His father was a British civil servant, and he groomed Edmund to take a position of power in the Empire. However, early on, the boy had a mind of his own. For a while, his inclination was to go to sea, but that ended when one of his forebear's in the Queen's Navy was court-martialed for exceeding his \"wine bill\". In addition to that, Edmund had poor eyesight and perhaps most importantly, he was his mother's darling, and she kept having visions of shipwrecks and desert island strandings. As for the civil service, to the boy it seemed like a \"continent of unexplored boredom\". He attended St. Olaf's College and would attend King's College in London as well. Surprisingly, he excelled at rugby and amateur boxing. Meanwhile, he developed a strong inclination to the stage, partly because of his admiration for the great English actor, . A major roadblock to that ambition, however, was his father, who, at that time, was stationed in Ireland. When Edmund broke the news to his father that he had chosen acting as a career, there followed \"a scene without parallel in Victorian melodrama.\" His father called the theatre \"that sink of iniquity.\" He predicted that, if Edmund went into theatre, he would end up in the gutter, and then literally \"showed him the door.\" Years later his father would admit he had been wrong, but that didn't help the young man during an all-night crossing from Dublin to England during which he had time to reflect. He was penniless. His experience consisted of a few performances in amateur productions, and he knew that if he failed, there was no going back home. However, in 1895, at the age of eighteen, he made his first appearance on the English stage with a group of amateurs just turned professional, playing two roles, \"Dodo Twinkle\" and \"Damper\", in \"Rogue and Vagabond\". For a long time afterward, he refused to go on stage without a false beard or some other disguise, fearing someone would recognize him and tell his father (it's a bit ironic, by the way, that Edmund's younger brother Arthur would also become an actor using the name of ). During the next few years, roles were hard to come by but, by 1899, he made his first appearance on the West End in London in \"A Jealous Mistake\". This was followed by ten years in the hinterlands acting with stock and touring companies, gradually working his way up from small parts to juicier roles. While with Edmund Tearle's Repertory Company, which toured the provinces, he played a different role each night. It was excellent training, in that he acted in everything from to old melodrama. About this time, he married Minnie Terry, niece of the more famous actress , a marriage that evidently was short-lived. Most sources list it as beginning and ending in 1901, perhaps only for a matter of days or even hours. From that point, Gwenn would remain a bachelor for the rest of his life. He seems to have preferred not going into any details about the marriage and divorce, and Minnie Terry, who outlived Gwenn, apparently never mentioned what happened, at least not publicly. That same year, however, he went to Australia and acted there for three years, not returning to London until 1904. There, he took a small part in \"In the Hospital\", which led to his receiving a postcard from , offering him a leading role as \"Straker\", the Cockney chauffeur, in \"Man and Superman\". Gwenn accepted (by this time he was Edmund Gwenn) and the play was a success. Shaw became a sort of professional godfather for him. He appeared in \"John Bull's Island\", \"Major Barbara\", \"You Never Can Tell\", \"Captain Brassbound's Conversion\" and \"The Devil's Disciple\", all by Shaw. He spent three years in Shaw's company, years which he called \"the happiest I've ever had in the theatre\". From 1908 until 1915, he performed in new plays by noted playwrights of the time, including 's \"The Campden Wonder\", 'John Galsworthy''s \"Justice\" and \"The Skin Game\", 's \"What Every Woman Knows\" and \"The Twelve Pound Look\", as well as 's \"The Wild Duck\" and 's \"The Voysey Inheritance\". By this time, World War I had started and Gwenn, despite his poor eyesight, was conscripted into the British Army. Most of his time during \"The Great War\" was spent drawing supplies up to the front lines, while under fire. He was so successful at this task that, after a year as a private, he received a steady stream of promotions until eventually becoming a captain. After the War, he returned to the stage and, in 1921, made his first appearance in the US in \"A Voice from the Minaret\" and \"Fedora\". He would return to America in 1928 to replace his friend, , who had died while in rehearsal for \"The House of Arrows\", but for most of this time, he was in England doing more stage roles and two dozen British films. His first appearance on screen was in a British short, in 1916, while he was still in the army. His next film roles were in Shaw's and 's . He was also in in 1920 and a silent version of \"The Skin Game\" () as \"Hornblower\", a role he would reprise in 1931 for a talking version () directed by . From then on, Gwenn was to work steadily until the end of his life. He appeared in English stage plays and films, eventually doing more and more on Broadway and in Hollywood. For example, he played the amiable counterfeiter in \"Laburnum Grove\" in 1933 (later to become the film in which he would star) and then with the entire British company brought it to New York. He was also a huge success in \"The Wookey\" in 1942, playing a Cockney tugboat captain. That same year, he appeared as \"Chebutykin\" in 's \"The Three Sisters\", with , and . In such illustrious company, Gwenn was hailed by critics as \"magnificent\" and \"superlatively good\". In 1935, RKO summoned him to Hollywood to portray 's father in . From then on, he was much in demand, appearing in , , , and . In 1940, he was the delightful \"Mr. Bennet\" in , then made a 180-degree turn by playing a folksy assassin in 's . The year 1941 brought , , and . Then came , in which he romanced , masquerading as a woman. Other important films included , , and . In 1945, he played villain \"Albert Richard Kingby\" in . There is a peculiar scene in this film, which makes one wonder what director was thinking. and , the hero and heroine, are being held by the villainous Gwenn in a room, when Gwenn comes in to interrogate them. In the midst of this, the 33-year-old, 6'2\" Craig punches the 68-year-old, 5'5\" Gwenn in the belly and then forces the doubled-over Gwenn to release them. Admittedly, Craig and Hasso must escape, and Gwenn's character is pretty evil, but knocking the wind out of the old man makes Craig seem like a bully and far less sympathetic. After \"Dangerous Partners\", Gwenn was in , , , , , and . In , he played one of his most unlikable characters, a father who beats his son, smashes his violin and shoots his dog. Then in 1947, he struck it rich. Twentieth Century-Fox was planning . It had offered the role of \"Kris Kringle\" to Gwenn's cousin, the well-known character actor , but he had turned it down with the observation that \"Americans don't like whimsy\". Fox then offered it to Gwenn, who pounced on it. His performance was to earn him an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor (at age 71) and, because it is rerun every Christmas season, he would become for many their all-time favorite screen Santa. Accepting the award, Gwenn said, \"Now I know there is a Santa Claus\". He beat out some stiff competition: (), (), () and (). As soon as he got the part, Gwenn went to work turning himself into Santa Claus. Though rotund, Gwenn didn't feel he was rotund enough to look like the jolly old elf most people expected after having read 's \"The Night before Christmas\", in which Santa \"had a broad face and a little round belly / That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.\" He could of course wear padding, but he resisted that as too artificial. So he put on almost 30 pounds for the role, a fair amount for a man of his short stature, and added nearly five inches to his waistline. The problem was that after the film was finished, Gwenn found it hard to lose the extra weight. \"I've been stocky all my adult life,\" he said, \"but now I must accept the fact that I'm fat.\" As was his nature, he didn't get upset, and instead was able to laugh about it. Six years later, when playing an elderly professor in , he had a scene in which he entered the Prince's chamber, struggling with the buttons of a ceremonial uniform. The line he was given was, \"I'm too old to wear a uniform,\" but Gwenn suggested a change which stayed in the finished film, \"I'm too old and fat to wear a uniform.\" Gwenn had lost his hair early on, and had no more concern about it than he did about his portliness. In a fair number of films, such as , he appears bald, but he also played many roles with a toupee if he felt that worked better for the character. He would select a hairpiece that helped achieve the look he was after for the role. As regards the rest of his appearance, Gwenn is commonly listed as 5'6\" tall, which may have been accurate when he was a younger man, but by the time he was a Hollywood regular he appears to be at least two inches shorter. Plagued by weak eyesight since his youth, Gwenn wore a pince-nez for a while, and then glasses, off-screen and sometimes on. Though he enjoyed fine clothes, he does not seem to have been in the least bit vain about any physical shortcomings he may have had. He looked a bit like a benign clergyman, perhaps of the Anglican faith, an image enhanced by his soft, almost soothing voice. He once said he was \"always short and stocky, and not a particularly handsome thing. I could never play romantic leads.\" After \"Miracle on 34th Street,\" however, Gwenn was a star and constantly in demand, especially when the role called for a kindly eccentric. Gwenn remained a British subject all his life. When he first moved to Hollywood, he lived at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. His home in London had been reduced to rubble during the bombings by the Luftwaffe in World War II. Only the fireplace survived. What Gwenn regretted most was the loss of the memorabilia he had collected of the famous actor Henry Irving. Eventually Gwenn bought a house at 617 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills, which he was to share with his secretary and \"confidential man\", Ernest C. Bach, and later with former Olympic athlete Rodney Soher. The year 1950 brought a pair of interesting films. In he and Charles Coburn were romantic rivals for the hand of . In one scene Gwenn socks Coburn in the jaw, though Coburn later bests him in arm wrestling. Gwenn wins Byington's hand in the end. He was also delightful in as a kindly counterfeiter. Gwenn received his second Oscar nomination for his performance, though this time he lost out to in He did, however, win the Golden Globe Award. In 1952 he appeared in as Grandpa Patrick Ryan, affecting an Irish brogue for the role. He played football coach Pop Doyle, teamed up with a chimpanzee, in . \"The Student Prince\" followed in 1954, as did the science-fiction classic . This film raises an interesting observation. The year before, Cecil Kellaway had appeared in another sci-fi classic, . Watch the two films together and you'll see that the two cousins are playing essentially the same role, that of an elderly scientist with a lovely daughter who is able to provide the hero, and the audience, with some scholarly background on the dangers they face. The two actors could easily have switched roles. \"Them!\" is noteworthy, too, in that it was a particularly physically painful part for Gwenn. By this time he was 77 and suffering from advanced arthritis. Several scenes in the movie were filmed in the desert, where the temperature often reached 110 degrees. The costumer had outfitted him in a wool suit for some of the early scenes. , who played his daughter, has noted that Gwenn was in great discomfort and almost certainly could not have continued without the help of his valet, Ernest. The next year Gwenn was in and . His film work has some interesting patterns. \"Dog's Life\" was at least the third time Gwenn made a film centered on a dog. He had already co-starred with as Lassie in and . \"Harry\" was Gwenn's fourth picture directed by , the others being \"The Skin Game\", and \"Foreign Correspondent\". Gwenn's last feature film was , shot in Spain and released in 1958, when he was 81. As for TV, his most memorable role may have been as a snowman that comes to life in a Christmas night telecast on from a story by , \"Heart of Gold\". Gwenn's final days were spent at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, California. Having endured terrible arthritis for many years, he had suffered a stroke, and then contracted pneumonia, from which he died at age 81 on September 6, 1959. His body was cremated, and his ashes were originally stored in a private vault at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles. In March 2023, Gwenn's misplaced urn was found in the vault by Hollywood Graveyard creator Arthur Dark and researcher Jessical Wahl. Dark and Wahl created a GoFundMe campaign to fund moving Gwenn's urn to a publicly accessible location and, on December 3, 2023, Gwenn's urn was reinurned in the Cathedral Mausoleum at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Gwenn had appointed Rodney Soher as the executor of his will, in which he had left Minnie Terry one-third of his estate, his sister Elsie Kellaway a third, and Ernest Bach a third, in addition to his clothes, shoes, linens, ties and luggage. However, for some reason, while he was spending his last days at the Motion Picture Home, Gwenn signed a codicil to his will, in which he said he had given Bach the lump sum of $5000, and that was all he was to receive. After Gwenn's death, Bach challenged the codicil, claiming that Gwenn was not of sound mind while in the Home and that some unnamed person--possibly referring to Soher--had unduly influenced Gwenn to change his will. The outcome is not known. There is a story that has been around for years that shortly before he died a visitor observed, \"It must be hard [to die]\", to which Gwenn replied, \"Dying is easy. Comedy is hard\". The story and the wording vary somewhat from teller to teller. Gwenn may indeed have said it, but he may have been repeating someone else. The quotation has also been ascribed to several earlier wits, including his mentor and the famous actor . Gwenn's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame can be found at 1751 Vine Street."

    "description": "Perhaps not so surprisingly, John Payne maintained that his favorite movie of all time was one of his own -- Miracle on 34th Street (1947) -- simply because it reflected his own strong and spiritual belief system. Today, of course, the film, which co-stars beautiful Maureen O'Hara, Oscar-winning Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle and little non-believing scene-steal , is a perennial holiday favorite and his best-remembered film role despite the mighty fine product he turned out over the years. Born John Howard Payne on May 28, 1912 (not May 23, according to his daughter, actress ), he was the middle son of three boys (Peter and Robert were the others). His parents, businessman George Washington Payne and Ida Hope (ne Schaeffer) Payne were quite well-to-do and came from a rich heritage. John was named after an ancestor who wrote the song, \"Home, Sweet, Home.\" The boys grew up privileged on a Roanoke, Virginia estate complete with equestrian stables and swimming pools. At his mother's request, John took singing lessons in order to curb an extreme shyness problem. During his teens, the boy was shipped off to Mercersburg Academy, a prep school in Pennsylvania, and later was studying at Roanoke College at the time his father died. John was forced to give up his studies in an effort to help support his family, finding work as a male nurse and, better yet, a radio singer at a local station. Eventually, he was able to return to his studies, enrolling at the Pulitzer School of Journalism at Columbia University. John continued to find work as a singer and even earned some extra cash as a boxer and wrestler. The tall (6'2\"), dark, and handsome Payne, in his mid-20s, eventually turned to the stage and, while understudying in the musical \"At Home Abroad,\" was spotted by during a performance signed for film work. Billed initially as John Howard Payne, he made his debut with a minor role in , but nothing else came of it and he was released. Freelancing in minor musicals and comedies, he appeared in a starring role (billed now as John Payne) opposite soon-to-be acting guru in , and also teamed up vocally with on a radio show. Payne met actress during this time and the couple married in August of 1937. Three years later they had a daughter, , who would become an actress in her own right. The happiness for John and Anne wouldn't last, however, and the couple divorced in 1943. In 1937, Paramount took over the actor's interest with a featured part in 's . Warner Bros. then signed him up briefly, allowing him a third-billed role in the musical starring and in which he sang the title song as well as the tune \"Love Is Where You Find It,\" among others. Again, John didn't have the right studio fit until 20th Century-Fox came along in 1940. Then it all began to happen for him. Co-starring roles opposite in the musicals and , and with popular skating star in and started the ball rolling. But it was a starring role in the war tearjerker , in which he was romantically paired with , that secured his place as a dramatic actor and gave him one of his best career showcases. After co-starring with former radio partner in , John served a two-year hitch (1942-1944) with the Army. Upon his discharge he went right back to courting in the musical film and met 18-year-old singer/actress during its shoot. The twosome wed in 1945 and a daughter and son were born within three years. Problems arose when Gloria insisted on continuing her career and the couple, after on and off separations, finally divorced in 1950. John's early post-WWII work offered some of his finest roles with significant non-singing parts coming in the form of with which was a project he bought for himself, the glossy epic co-starring , , again paired up magically with O'Hara, and with . After John left 20th Century-Fox, his film vehicles grew more routine. Crimers, war drama, and westerns became the norm but a smart and lucrative business arrangement (that included a seven-picture deal) with action producers and (Pine-Thomas Productions) compensated greatly. As such John appeared in , , , . , and ended the deal with . A shrewd businessman, Payne also obtained rights to these films in the aftermath. In 1953, he entered into his third and final marriage to Alexandra (\"Sandy\") Crowell Curtis, the former wife of actor . In addition to returning to his singing roots with Las Vegas showroom engagements, John went on to star in his own western TV series which lasted two seasons. Daughter Julie appeared in one episode. A very serious 1961 accident, however, in which John was hit by a car in New York City, slowed him down considerably. It took well over two years for him to recover enough from his leg fractures and facial/scalp wounds to return to acting. In 1964, he co-starred on Broadway with in the Broadway musical \"Here's Love\". A decade later he returned to the arms of when they reunited on stage with a Broadway revival of \"Good News\". Unfortunately he had to leave the show prematurely as the dancing required was re-aggravating his leg pain. His 70s career ended with TV roles on such shows as \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Cade's Country\" and \"Columbo\". Retiring in 1975, John focused quietly on reading, writing short stories, flying, and cooking. In addition to daughter Julie, two of his grandchildren went on to become actresses as well -- and . The 77-year-old Payne died on December 6, 1989 at his Malibu home of congestive heart failure. A reliable and steady leading man who may not have been a great mover or shaker on screen, he nonetheless brought tremendous entertainment to the industry and his fans both musically and dramatically in a career that lasted four decades."

The athletic Vallone, a former soccer player who often was compared to Burt Lancaster, was born Raffaele Vallone in 1916 in Tropea in Calabria, Italy, the son of a prominent lawyer and his aristocratic wife. At the University of Turin, Vallone took degrees in law and philosophy and then entered his father's law firm.
