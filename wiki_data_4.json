(1966).\nThrough the next decade and a half, Segal consistently starred in notable films across a variety of genres including The Quiller Memorandum (1966), The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (1967), No Way to Treat a Lady (1968), The Bridge at Remagen (1968), Where's Poppa?

(1997–2003) and Albert \"Pops\" Solomon on The Goldbergs (2013–2021). Segal was also an accomplished banjo player. (In addition to the banjo, he frequently played other small lute instruments such as the ukulele and dobro on TV and in his movies.) He released three albums and performed with the instrument in several of his acting roles and on late-night television.",

In 1942, he appeared in Irving Berlin's This Is the Army and became a major star of CBS Radio. In the 1960s, he successfully crossed over into country music, recording hits such as \"A Little Bitty Tear\" and \"Funny Way of Laughin'\". Ives was also a popular film actor through the late 1940s and '50s. His film roles included parts in So Dear to My Heart (1948) and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), as well as the role of Rufus Hannassey in The Big Country (1958), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the film noir Day of the Outlaw (1959).\nIves is often associated with the Christmas season. He did voice-over work as Sam the Snowman, narrator of the classic 1964 Christmas television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Ives also worked on the special's soundtrack, including the songs \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", both of which continue to chart annually on the Billboard holiday charts into the 2020s.\n\n",

Despite being heavily courted by Hollywood, Belmondo refused to appear in English-language films. During his career, he was called the French counterpart of actors such as James Dean, Marlon Brando and Humphrey Bogart. Described as an icon and national treasure of France, Belmondo was seen as an influential actor in French cinema and an important figure in shaping European cinema. In 1989, Belmondo won the César Award for Best Actor for his performance in Itinéraire d'un enfant gâté. He was nominated for two BAFTA Awards throughout his career. In 2011, Belmondo received the Palme d'honneur at the Cannes Film Festival, and in 2017 he received the César d'honneur at the 42nd César Awards.",

In 2004, Comedy Central ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics. \nMartin first came to public notice as a writer for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1969, and later as a frequent host on Saturday Night Live. He became one of the most popular American stand-up comedians during the 1970s, performing his brand of offbeat, absurdist comedy routines before sold-out theaters on national tours. He then starred in films such as The Jerk (1979), Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982), The Man with Two Brains (1983), All of Me (1984), ¡Three Amigos! (1986), Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), L.A. Story (1991), Bowfinger (1999) and Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003). He played family patriarchs in Parenthood (1989), the Father of the Bride films (1991–1995), Bringing Down the House (2003), and the Cheaper by the Dozen films (2003–2005).\nSince 2015, Martin has embarked on several national comedy tours with fellow comedian Martin Short. In 2018, they released their Netflix special An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life which received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations. In 2021, he co-created and starred in his first television show, the Hulu comedy series Only Murders in the Building, alongside Short and Selena Gomez, for which he earned three Primetime Emmy Award nominations, two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, a Golden Globe Award nomination, and a 2021 Peabody Award nomination. In 2022, Martin and Short co-hosted Saturday Night Live together with Gomez making an appearance.\nMartin is also known for writing the books to the musical Bright Star (2016) and to the comedy Meteor Shower (2017), both of which premiered on Broadway; he co-wrote the music to the former. Martin has played banjo since an early age and has included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career. He has released several music albums and has performed with various bluegrass acts. He has won three Grammy Awards for his music and two for his comedy albums Let's Get Small (1977) and A Wild and Crazy Guy (1978).",

Considered one of the greatest running backs of all time, as well as one of the greatest players in NFL history, Brown was selected to a Pro Bowl and All-Pro team every season he was in the league, and was recognized as the AP NFL Most Valuable Player three times. Brown won an NFL championship with the Browns in 1964. He led the league in rushing yards in eight out of his nine seasons, and by the time he retired, he held most major rushing records. In 1999, he was named the greatest professional football player ever by The Sporting News and the Associated Press.\nBrown earned unanimous All-America honors playing college football at Syracuse University, where he was an all-around player for the Syracuse Orangemen football team. The team later retired his number 44 jersey, and he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995. He is also widely considered one of the greatest lacrosse players of all time, and the Premier Lacrosse League MVP Award is named in his honor. Brown also excelled in basketball and track and field.\nIn his professional career, Brown carried the ball 2,359 times for 12,312 rushing yards and 106 touchdowns, which were all records when he retired. He averaged 104.3 rushing yards per game and is the only player in NFL history to average over 100 rushing yards per game for his career. Brown was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. He was named to the NFL's 50th, 75th, and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams, composed of the best players in NFL history. Brown was honored at the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship as the greatest college football player of all time. His number 32 jersey is retired by the Browns.\nShortly before the end of his football career, Brown became an actor. He retired at the peak of his football career to pursue an acting career. He obtained 53 acting credits and several leading roles throughout the 1970s. He has been described as Hollywood's first black action hero and his role in the 1969 film 100 Rifles made cinematic history for featuring interracial love scenes.\nBrown was one of the few athletes, and among the most prominent African Americans, to speak out on racial issues as the civil rights movement was growing in the 1950s. He participated in the Cleveland Summit after Muhammad Ali faced imprisonment for refusing to enter the draft for the Vietnam War, and he founded the Black Economic Union to help promote economic opportunities for minority-owned businesses. Brown later launched a foundation focused on diverting at-risk youth from violence through teaching them life skills, through which he facilitated the Watts truce between rival street gangs in Los Angeles.",

He is the recipient of several accolades including a National Film Award, four Filmfare Awards and an Asia Pacific Screen Award. In 2017, he appeared on Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list.\nAfter studying acting at the Film and Television Institute of India, Rao made his acting debut with the anthology film Love Sex Aur Dhokha (2010) and took on supporting roles in the films Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2 and Talaash: The Answer Lies Within (both 2012). He had his breakthrough in 2013 with critically acclaimed performances in the dramas Kai Po Che! and Shahid. His portrayal of lawyer Shahid Azmi in the latter won him the National Film Award for Best Actor and the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.\nRao's career progressed with supporting roles in Queen (2014), Aligarh (2015), and Bareilly Ki Barfi (2017), with the latter winning him the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. He had lead roles in the independent films Trapped (2016) and Newton (2017), with the former winning him his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor and the latter earning him the Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Performance by an Actor. Rao had his biggest success to that point in the comedy horror film Stree (2018), and his first English-film role in the satire The White Tiger (2021).\nFurther praise came for his starring roles in Ludo (2020), Monica, O My Darling (2022), Bheed (2023), and Srikanth (2024). He won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for starring as a closeted gay man in Badhaai Do (2022). Following a series of commercial failures, he found success with the sequel Stree 2 (2024) and the fantasy film Bhool Chuk Maaf (2025), the former of which ranks as his highest-grossing release, although he faced criticism for repeatedly playing similar roles. Rao is married to actress Patralekha.\n\n",

Martin gained his career breakthrough together with comedian Jerry Lewis, billed as Martin and Lewis, in 1946.

He established himself as a singer, recording numerous contemporary songs as well as standards from the Great American Songbook. Martin became one of the most popular acts in Las Vegas and was known for his friendship with fellow artists Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., who together with several others formed the Rat Pack.\nStarting in 1965, Martin was the host of the television variety program The Dean Martin Show, which centered on Martin's singing and comedic talents and was characterized by his relaxed, easy-going demeanor. From 1974 to 1984, Martin was roastmaster on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast, a popular show that drew celebrities, comedians and politicians. Throughout his career, Martin performed on concert stages, in nightclubs and audio recordings and appeared in 85 film and television productions and sold 12 million records in the United States alone, over 50 million worldwide. Martin's best-known songs include \"Ain't That a Kick in the Head?\", \"Memories Are Made of This\", \"That's Amore\", \"Everybody Loves Somebody\", \"You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You\", \"Sway\", and \"Volare\".\n\n",

He had a decades-long relationship with Chicago's Goodman Theatre where much of his O'Neill work originated. He also regularly played Canada's Stratford Festival, especially in works by William Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett. He once gave credit for his award-winning performances to the plays’ authors: \"When you walk with giants, you learn how to take bigger steps.\" Dennehy was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 2010.",

The core group consisted of brothers Chico Marx, Harpo Marx, and Groucho Marx; earlier in their career, they were joined by younger brothers Gummo and Zeppo.  They are considered by critics, scholars and fans to be among the greatest and most influential comedians of the 20th century, a recognition underscored by the American Film Institute (AFI) selecting five of their fourteen feature films to be among the top 100 comedy films (with two in the top fifteen) and including them as the only group of performers on AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list of the 25 greatest male stars of Classical Hollywood cinema.\nTheir performing lives, heavily influenced by their mother, Minnie Marx, started with Groucho on stage at age 14, in 1905.  He was joined, in succession, by Gummo and Harpo.  Chico started a separate vaudeville act in 1911, and joined his brothers in 1912.  Zeppo replaced Gummo when the latter joined the army in World War I. The brothers performed together in vaudeville until 1923, when they found themselves banned from the major vaudeville circuits owing to a dispute with E. F. Albee.  Failing in an attempt to produce their own shows on the alternate Shubert circuit, they transitioned to Broadway, where they achieved significant success with a series of hit musical comedies, including I'll Say She Is, The Cocoanuts, and Animal Crackers.\nIn 1928, the brothers made a deal with Paramount Pictures to produce a film version of The Cocoanuts, which they filmed at Astoria Studios during the Broadway run of Animal Crackers.  The Cocoanuts was released in 1929, followed shortly thereafter with a film version of Animal Crackers.  The brothers decided to devote their careers to film, and moved to Los Angeles, where they made three more films for Paramount: Monkey Business (1931), Horse Feathers (1932), and Duck Soup (1933).  When their contract with Paramount expired, Zeppo left the group. The remaining brothers were signed by Irving Thalberg to make movies for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  It was there that they made A Night at the Opera (1935), which they considered their crowning achievement.\nDuring the production of their next film, A Day at the Races (1937), Thalberg died.  While they continued to make films, they felt that the quality of their work, and their interest in it, declined.  After briefly moving to RKO to make Room Service (1938), they went back to work at MGM, making At the Circus (1939), Go West (1940), and The Big Store (1941) before declaring that they were retired.  They briefly came out of retirement twice. In 1946, they made A Night in Casablanca, reportedly because Chico was running out of money.  In 1949, they starred together in Love Happy; originally intended to be a solo vehicle for Harpo, producers felt the film would be more successful with all three brothers.  That was to be their last film as a trio.  Groucho went on to a successful career as a game show host, while Harpo and Chico continued to make guest appearances in television and on stage.",

He appeared in the West End when he starred in A Sleeping Clergyman in 1933, and in 1936 he took on the management of the West End's Queen's Theatre.\nIn his book, The Age of the Dream Palace, Jeffrey Richards wrote that Donat was \"British cinema's one undisputed romantic leading man in the 1930s\". \"The image he projected was that of the romantic idealist, often with a dash of the gentleman adventurer.\"\nDonat suffered from chronic (and possibly psychosomatic) asthma, which affected his career and limited him to appearing in only 19 films.",

      "full_extract": "Blaskó Béla Ferenc Dezső  (Hungarian: [ˈblɒʃkoː ˈbeːlɒ ˈfɛrɛnt͡s ˈdɛʒøː]; October 20, 1882 – August 16, 1956), better known by the stage name Bela Lugosi ( lə-GOH-see; Hungarian: [ˈluɡoʃi]), was a Hungarian–American actor. He was best remembered for portraying Count Dracula in the horror film classic Dracula (1931), Ygor in Son of Frankenstein (1939) and his roles in many other horror films from 1931 through 1956.\nLugosi began acting on the Hungarian stage in 1902. After playing in 172 productions in his native Hungary, Lugosi moved on to appear in Hungarian silent films in 1917. He had to suddenly emigrate to Germany after the failed Hungarian Communist Revolution of 1919 because of his former socialist activities (organizing a stage actors' union), leaving his first wife in the process. He acted in several films in Weimar Germany, before arriving in New Orleans as a seaman on a merchant ship, then making his way north to New York City and Ellis Island.\nIn 1927, he starred as Count Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, moving with the play to the West Coast in 1928 and settling down in Hollywood. He later starred in the 1931 film version of Dracula directed by Tod Browning and produced by Universal Pictures. Through the 1930s, he occupied an important niche in horror films, but his notoriety as Dracula and thick Hungarian accent greatly limited the roles offered to him, and he unsuccessfully tried for years to avoid typecasting.\nHe co-starred in a number of films with Boris Karloff, who was able to demand top billing for his status a horror icon and had portrayed characters such as Frankenstein's monster in the horror film Frankenstein (1931). Lugosi, a charter member of the American Screen Actors Guild, was frustrated over increasingly being restricted to mad scientist roles because of his inability to speak English more clearly. He was kept employed by the studios principally so that they could put his name on the posters and prevent others from doing so. Among his teamings with Karloff, he performed major roles only in The Black Cat (1934), The Raven (1935), and Son of Frankenstein (1939); even in The Raven, Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role.\nBy this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for sciatic neuritis, and he became addicted to doctor-prescribed morphine and methadone. This drug dependence (and his gradually worsening alcoholism) was becoming apparent to producers, and after 1948's Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, the offers dwindled to parts in low-budget films; some of these were directed by Ed Wood, including a brief appearance in Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space (released posthumously in 1957).\nLugosi married five times and had one son, Bela G. Lugosi (with his fourth wife, Lillian).\n\n",

Extending his repertoire into West End theatre, he has since performed in the stage adaptation of Swimming with Sharks with Christian Slater, followed a year later by a critically acclaimed performance in That Face.\nSmith's first television role came in 2006 as Jim Taylor in the BBC adaptations of Philip Pullman's The Ruby in the Smoke and The Shadow in the North, while his first major role in television came as Danny in the 2007 BBC series Party Animals. In film, he has played a dual role in the science fiction film Womb (2010), the physical forms of Skynet in the cyberpunk action film Terminator Genisys (2015), a 1960s pimp in the psychological horror film Last Night in Soho (2021) and Milo Morbius in the superhero film Morbius (2022).",
